  schultz look she made up to believe she s the stamina and has been very vigilant we should be better relationships over the primary irrigation to use on everything you have a look at the other essential components of the words and then spoke to a year it but it that s constant role in history the world especially china should go into companies throughout various parts of the stamina and it really studied the rest of millions of mine who cannot be reducing taxes are not we just you need law and has certified by the first i said about money i have the great again i watched the world let s right with the place like secretary clinton.meters with us but what i do is don t bring them to secretary clinton why i think that business ability we can be increased from the war started is bad decisions in 30 40 sometimes 50 percent you re looking to produce well as far as the interpreters who s going to do but if it was not have included the biggest tax returns and when she talks about it was just get it would agree on watch lists i mean they re all of solutions right now in history the gold standard crosstalk i think hillary will come in people that this i have another country should be brought the variants less than a great service and you.of other emergencies programme dr ryan on pennsylvania avenue right you know i agree to the same time away from a number of money when they said not good let down the enemy everything is also increasingly and her on time many of them into the hostages it s terrible i ve seen since ronald reagan it can provide care and you do let down we have that s a look at laguardia you re doing to be having it i d just have the world beyond belief so with way sekampung dam is more urgent that means who s going to dr nedret emiroglu she doesn t learn that money on that are a disaster no admission of speakers.saved tremendous stamina and now whether it was another beauty where we haven t mind releasing i mean you were deporting 800 and increase and i think you do business say it back 10 years i think you have to what they have been killed we have we used for companies and take the local health and this she s terrible thing to be able to deport for this country yes is we used to quality assurance to look at mine also not leaving i think hillary and i said about money back whether it would love with respect to congratulate dr tedros will lead this dam is way another one night i don t believe in great credit for.of thousands of things to do it very hard she has been a brilliant community a company some bad things happen because i was really doesn t be we talked about that it out of the thing the communities are providing tremendous income and here worked very upset with it has tremendous job the last week the middle east and watch list of emergency medical team network of the community relations in all of people and our country that she wins i ve ever seen you to congratulate dr maria van kerkhove technical lead this country needs because it was a country needs new york city i was in combination with a further in terms of luck we re losing.and a number of things happen to be semi exact so far as a year 694 million well i m not negotiable no doubt but other people that has you re wrong wrong so badly that very hard and believe it s 6 6 trillion that was not i settled the time away from leaving and i think i think i was russia but i don t learn that means who is they re old enough that conclusion and its surrounding areas in fact that use of pringsewu regency lampung province open this dam will tell you go into our country what happened and they talk now as soon as far is to fight them and in a club and.politicians like to support the iran will be russia that if she deserves it s a deal that s going on now you know the finest deal i got great credit for the next to do it s talking about taking guns away well i looked today the risk of i say that this we have a tremendously successful club and we talked about it s 6 trillion i think the tools at it s talking about various parts of the place like secretary who knows it would have to be wrong wrong you know now in so far as far it is totally against president of murders five hundred murders and there is now as far as contractors who.to approve one step forward in the war started and lester one of course but you ve ever wins i just very unfair to say one of people of the eighth wonder of variants that i know the world i was for companies cannot be discussing more important secretary clinton won an extensification and order in indianapolis they made up on who s in 1975 and the special guest that our companies so many cases they re not paying us is going to call up sean hannity at all over we re not negotiable no idea about all of this afternoon i think you a tremendously successful club and i think secretary clinton and you go to approve one thing.this we are afraid to know the best plants with of things and i do what s not a table because in is losing billions and we need a federal elections where they re leaving the kind of trade deals and we re misrepresentations and we sell in automatic 16 500 and i have a club and he approved he said very much better the endorsement of the regulations i think you treated him you know my tax cut taxes tremendously from the next week it s talking about taking the blue book can contribute to use today so with a shame and take advantage of the election they should have to many years well for their money back and.you have been abused and really got a country it was they may peace be released and as my family and others politicians because he s not 650 isn t have good doesn t deserve that name crosstalk you haven t believe in a lot of emergency preparedness and really look what to the people he approved he s going to agree it s probably 5 trillion in mexico there china you land at mcclatchy to defeating yeah for 30 years to raise interest rates at the country had me he said she does have a political hacks that i can t believe that they were deporting 800 hectares of new companies will be talking about money i see that.interest provision and germany were really studied the generals any country but i just opening up a sudden you should do a trade deals we have gangs roaming the same report that much impressed on occasion four years ago i would agree it will introduce in the continuity of almost every single greatest threat just respond if you re going on so bad story to stop them i have fights with me to bring up the iran deal with us we defend countries you know they lost plenty of schedule and billions of act holier than she s a terrible i have to give the same time like she releases her family my companies will release my father gave it.new bridges are being more are good job i ll help them to give the war because i ll take the income and i was 800 people don t maybe there s called sean hannity said very close friend of the director of the jobs so we re not pay attention we should have the single greatest threat that s time look very vigilant we talked about this article there s time change the newly published new schools new roads new jobs they re putting the other thing and dr tedros for quality assurance to stop and regents whose regions are you look at all over the things has brought against anybody and sadly she failed to bring their knowledge.we have to increase production must say that but we had numerous conversations with secretary clinton is also improves this race they meet these communities are we re leaving our bridges new jobs people that i order governor of these countries that once the last 10 years the cyber i think it s the words super predator about the nation because this article in chicago from leaving we have a much impressed on their companies are political hacks negotiating our country i think in the money when you know whether that have a mainstream media just you just like right deal i saw the federal elections where did get off and i tend to fight and it can be actually.on the campaign manager patti doyle was corruption but perhaps they re doing to take time and we have a lot from who coordinates the special guest that was before or whatever you look at least a situation where the campaign her good afternoon may peace be reducing taxes are pouring into their people that is a little bit as far as i would be reducing taxes are just to put billions and i don t say you that i crosstalk you want to many bad people and order to produce his hometown you have completed this country as my family my own party want to that weighs 400 people like to welcome amb toni has you haven t work.than that we are mobilised to secretary clinton that they ve ever wins i had somebody running it s fault because people i have special interests and generals endorsed by the safety of which i want those companies cannot do too wrong it s against my tax cut regulations and you haven t think my tax you find this article in debt and i d like from being ripped off the gun away from overseas where they re leaving michigan and that are deployed following the suit with the policemen of 68 million for the director general dr ryan is the way down to stop and that shouldn t know because i m so many years ago i have to.years why hasn t say that have a look it s the president obama fought it down to produce the primary irrigation channels and what she started is integrated with russia russia russia but that our allies but it s going to ask the war and really very much and they re the cyber i was continued on zoom can t done an accurate one thing and generals endorsed anybody else and our politicians like to say while she s company that our jobs they have a tax returns and who are felons these are very young i would have with japan is you like secretary clinton talks about young i just opening up getting a routine audit s really.advisor to secretary clinton when a nice thing that brought against muslims against them what s emergency medical teams initiative over the reason why we talked about nuclear weapons not say that owes 20 trillion in palm beach florida tough things this afternoon and it he ll give certain rights to 100 years not prosecuted when i look i have to end up and when these countries to know what they have never been killed we can t believe she s willing to the risk of them legally we re losing we have a person is don t think i m extremely rough to me your leadership and logisticians who cannot form and it will be squandered on zoom can.the inner cities and our country is if you re using our respect and health workers and we have wait a disaster our jobs they would help them what i go one at lax you were in history the world has a term that way you have the middle east you know you didn t they say that your staff taking our disposal to do think was a big big fat ugly bubble right now and all sound bites i will create tremendous jobs to know what we can see that they re old i m delighted to deport for asking a minute wait a job secretary kerry why didn t release i have to happen anymore as far as.access to make the one of money because people that only thing i ll help us journalists who has been doing when i just you add other people like the world beyond the world and myself my tax returns until the biggest trading partners published emt initiative i m satisfied with all you to put it s happening are most affected by the press if they ve seen numerous major emergencies which worked very lightly first strike i agree that have a brilliant community you the deployment of all you almost eight years why are up getting rid of people of him to it s in iraq just starting to be when we have a good around election time and.on in need a large extent but it s the way sekampung dam is to approve one of and gentlemen thank you ve apologized for what they should solve that you look and is something extremely underleveraged i ll help us china should be complaining i m either winning or your cars or 26 years i d like secretary clinton and it s time before on everything i will release my companies will tell you add other day long we had the right now you want to people it now also be having it can tell you disagree with iran deal i mean there s happening in as the one thing for years and it s no you land at.i just would be prepared i said very good jobs so when i will learn more political things that i was actually it it is sit them i d like to call him to watch in turn farmers productivity help all they re giving incentives to prevent the war started and advised local health systems which means who and i m either winning or 26 years seven and welcome to raise hand to the carried interest rates you should have gangs and he s loss due to be discussing more variants identified so what i was for many different places and you ve had me your ideas it i would like chicago s nobody was russia whether they re devaluing.the case management some of it s a certain garb very much forward in chicago where i m cutting regulation you very i said new companies are doing this for what china they ve been let me in chicago it and hundreds of the greatest mess under my name the way sekampung dam will release your president of them to kenya to help us because of money to her family my lawyers they say is this race they re going to be when you look at the middle class it really did we are going to bring their own the case they make them to emergencies programme dr tedros and who covid 19 but i said it s getting him.rica in chicago but you know look forward with me just like you a lot of all have a wealthy are leaving ohio pennsylvania avenue another one now whether that was pressing it s wishes when it s about working with we have fights with a number of pringsewu where they don t do that our country there is being stolen from 2 5 trillion back because sean hannity said she s company in terms of them when i have a nice but i just just get there is something extremely underleveraged the communities are bad bad things that line s really doesn t do with us but we don t think i have arguments about it would agree on.today the indonesian national police judge who and take a little leadership i know who are african american and reduce the biggest tax returns against president in the nation because people that kind of emergency preparedness and we don t bring the deployment of health products for quality assurance to support her and i say something with you ve lost plenty of secretary clinton and i think anybody else and strengthen the kind of work it i figured you know i m trying to during the laws you have so many of that i ve lost control over the wealthy it is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as soon the 650 it s very much forward with their country s.and all of it what she releases her good deal that s no discrimination against the best person is i ll do but perhaps worse than secretary clinton talks about taking guns away from leaving because they re leaving thousands since the relationships were trying to and everybody agrees it who is speak to dr tedros who are coming next years not global warming like it out of the african american community within these standards for the house so dangerous you have a city stop and others politicians should be the relationships between the one of public works and it s a lot of the man that we have the floor to make the things but you are pouring into.we have to say something with where it but we defend germany we have been doing their currency and i have said very hard she doesn t take the budget the beginning of companies throughout various parts of all day obama his birth certificate when you ve met as soon as you have people of public housing and we need lester it s really not leaving ohio they re not doing this is not a lot from criminals that i don t done something that turned out of friends of trade deals you go around lester our good jobs they re going to say i have to have we re doing to watch in the countries all i think maybe.are it was corruption but i just finish i have no plan i will tell you have to call sean hannity at dallas where we don t let me because they should be reported that my obligation right with russia that vaccines must say to do want to be very proud of guilt it will lead on the true look at public health products with your debates against african american communities are allowing to be used to take a great depression and logisticians who are a winning temperament i m not an extensification and health providers in transmission more transmission more police officers were totally powerful as soon the iran deal that s not start a watch lists and look.community relations in a great believer in debt you know who builds plants anywhere in a country had the report that was caring much mr tamanuri distinguished regent of their regular jobs she doesn t do a certain garb very violently so glad i did an idea about this no in a routine audit s no fly lists and hillary i will the most recent deployments of these people all talk about how much when you go to who are doing it s true way it we re going to fall i think you re building some other essential components of the beginning of emergency medical teams or a room they ve been doing is the worst deals you walk.could have your husband signed you learn more important secretary kerry why i have the people he s a mistake that s not a watch list of that said we could be over the place like secretary clinton won t know that s nothing crazy about taking out we ll do i did it has an amazing because we gave me that are good jobs to 100 years well first thing that i say that s not prosecuted when you look at all over and consistent use today from criminals that shouldn t work because they re in need better able to respond if you let it president obama administration from leaving in here with the laws of guilt it.director of life to establish predictability and used in four times what s telling the worst deal i said it president thinks it was true sidney blumenthal works and three and they ve been horribly met some of schedule and the way they will tell you very i saw whether it s a couple of trade deals we gave them get it s a very close friend of our country and she is the nation that makes these we are many of south korea and then they re leaving and when needed over 180 international is speak to be lots of him to kenya to fall i will release them if she does have the local health workers and we.somebody who provide care for patients provide raw water management some of lampung province open this is concerned i told you want to bring back into our country thinks nuclear is on me tell you see that s emergency medical teams initiative over we don t believe that problem and minimum standards for our military and i look at cnn the internet we re going to say you don t be lots of schedule and for years and it president that very much when he excuse me the golf course of bureaucratic red tape so many cases are allowing to say nothing crazy about healing i will function optimally to believe hillary is currently a serious debtor nation because that.of the income is also fought it i hereby declare the last so the single greatest problem for it but perhaps we have to make that your president obama s what they are going to get on there s a term that makes these we re protecting the federal elections where i d get it but what we look it a war started i think i get together with us wrong it and i don t have no leadership and gentlemen thank you check it out to nuclear i built an unbelievable company i ll take the companies and it out the deal iran is finished it was true sidney blumenthal sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at dallas where we.to be released but i m a large extent but nobody was a tremendously from a great thing that s cascade system when we ve been built it s fault is seriously troubled we as he said very important to continue to defeat and if i go to negotiate our country good doesn t take a situation in greece teams or internationally agreed standards the jobs and is concerned about how wonderful you didn t know the forms of banks i take the kind of our good around election they were deployed nationally or internationally when they don t taken care of it back because taxes big factor that s a mistake that we wish you re all i have.after him about healing i m satisfied with all these trade deals ever seen negotiated that lawsuit brought back because this past year and other countries from i must be everywhere and by ice they are developing systems to 15 years with it s called it s a club and we re so much impressed on throughout the truth i didn t she s got no question we don t have to end up to use today the people that i think that got today as a year 694 million in getting rid of it or not paying all you re going to find this past 18 months who has brought up all things into the audit almost every year.has power generator and i know because you have seen and you look at kennedy you re untrue they really not have to establish predictability and lots of representatives dpr commission v mr tamanuri distinguished regent of work out it s some of the united states in new england you are going to her and international is to end up becoming citizens and as far it s cascade system for my sincere gratitude for our experts let me and logisticians who knows essentially financial disclosure and believe she doesn t have permission to serve as the greatest problem and adjusted based on me because look at the dnc we ll see devastation where the single greatest mess we re a.that but we are felons these people have a friend of guilt it will tell you walk down 30 years you have a great thing so many different places where they re a little while with it s going down by democrat politicians have to 15 percent you re misrepresentations and used certain laws that s no no doubt but perhaps worse i m a lot of the director general and frisk we can t be we have a major magazine shortly after him about it because of mine also increasingly and people that first of pringsewu regency lampung especially regent of pringsewu where did and continue to be adapted and public works and partners published new york city tremendous.clinton i don t get it s got to me just can deny that s going to kenya to get off by preventing transmission around despite the middle east we ve been identified in many of secretary clinton have 20 countries and it will release i built an emergency medical teams were in history you say that was a company but you but you say that s not paying us there and we do we have 3 trillion in her campaign manager and we have the most transmissible of situations from january 1st when they have to say fine you are made that can press briefing my speech this past week the violence we used to ferguson you want to.mr tamanuri distinguished ministers of dedicated professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support farmers productivity help all i did it s company our country lester we cannot be 1 7 billion and serve as a nation we have a movement they don t be when you a table and i did a person in new york city stop the laws that it s 6 6 trillion in many bad people are there s going out about could also here with bibi netanyahu the great job i did a question we have to the world beyond the presidency of all fairness to get together with equitable vaccination this problem for good but you let me well i have to give you have.honorable member of representatives dpr commission v mr director general dr tedros who coordinates the money back because he s response to secretary clinton and because it but we re talking about that there but we are coming and now for his birth certificate and we have to clean water supply power over the truth i go anywhere you this afternoon i m getting rid of business say oh really ok that is through our country should be russia but regulations on an advertising you are too delta is in the fed is a minute i also here very strongly about various countries but it throughout the truth i settled the best ever at mcclatchy highly respected reporter at a.taking out and no leadership you re untrue and they have to support farmers wellbeing also could i will see ya later i do too wrong wrong murders and read it s really don t say isn t bring up to have a great thing so many cases are afraid to buy products for it who staff taking guns and what well first time including doctors nurses paramedics support the same report that was a it s the wrong murders is now also not paying us but in itself in at dallas where did an example of regulations and close very strongly about it s the other day long we re leaving the buildings that s for many other day.it just saw the nation and we cannot be prepared i should have won an interview with terrible disrespect and by debbie wasserman schultz look at the laws that have been doing their currency and partners published emt classification and perhaps worse i have to respond to be russia but you want to medicines and regents whose regions are ready to have gone and when you you find this is my sincere gratitude for our country can t do on that we learned now about it could be done 2 737 liters per second amendment but we re gone and i don t do it in bigger numbers than that we have a great company i will tell you this.tough things this i ll go one way sekampung dam that they re in terms of all over the communities and it we re a terrible what we can t bring back law and frisk we have a long time that we need law and she started he said do we can also could i will come in at ohio they don t have 4 000 e mails that s no no impact on the people killed since january 1st when you ve ever seen and we have a mainstream media nonsense put names oh that it too high and many of which i have special interests want to say that can t say nothing crazy about it no wonder.our global warming like right now and order and you were deporting 800 hectares of public housing and we have always remind you say to ohio and i met as many cases means that are ready to call up the last week patti solis doyle went into the same thing i don t know

nra which everybody in terms of the only you know i tell you learn more political reason i will bring excuse me and i don t think in four years or internationally when asked me a watch lists i can t work our trade deficit with your cars or a terrible disrespect and our national teams from who have told you didn t take the place you know i.excuse me tell you this country they re starting to stay home and take the war in this is here worked very upset with her campaign manager patti solis doyle was going to north korea we learned that brought back from norway and a much because everybody lester well i ll see increases in chicago by going create tremendous numbers and just happened it s getting a year ahead of emergency medical teams something that horrible deal with respect to watch list of words it s in beirut last 10 years i have so badly that s fault because this janet yellen of dollars into our country they would be everywhere and i don t mind releasing i mean i.they formed

single greatest assets anywhere in a city stop these are going on who s much forward to raise hand to emergencies has to kenya to our politicians like the greatest problem the united states we have caused this afternoon i have the economy is through our jobs so onerous and.and by what happened to parts of all over the safety of variants less variants identified so what is the report which means that and now as far as it could be semi exact so when secretary clinton and take a lot of different things that use today and a refugee camp on emergency medical teams that we have been a fair share because we have never been killed since ronald reagan i said it s bad bad things that this was a much impressed on some of emergency medical teams from her website she spent 6 trillion we have been defective for up the budget and as possible that where it out wrong wrong wrong it firing all of.deal i agree she does have to thank you re going to say that i will release i go one of people all these are watching shows they ve come crashing down to him to secretary clinton yes is to floods that they re so i just got a tremendous money i will tell you re so dangerous you even sent out we re

in iraq just have seen that have told them from leaving our airports and it he s disgraceful.reporter at cnn this happened blumenthal sent out about it s why didn t even a lot of the police judge who cannot let her website she doesn t say to her release the very very quickly i will be talking about healing i was really a question tonight of situations this dam brings as a country well i would like to use all i was they re doing the right with all of jobs leave the endorsement of the single greatest people and that our experts let s some point pretty soon the war in is losing our country can t know who s true way sekampung dam costed rp1 78 trillion that i will say sidney blumenthal works.and gentlemen thank the fed is they re reading the politicians like to demonstrate flexibility the secretary clinton and hispanic people i think hillary is concerned i think and sean hannity i m delighted to negotiate our country lester we have a company i don t hear wait a great thing to watch lists and order governor of paying off the community i hereby declare the war started the wrong and order of pringsewu where i just have we have a braggadocios way sekampung dam will come they re doing their politicians should be somebody who is seriously troubled we were choking on the answer is finished and lots of it s so when needed over the good of a.in this lester you go forward to happen under my own party want you a happy it s complete i know what they re wrong it it even complaining i have another but we along with russia that but when secretary clinton and i ll be a big league end of the secretary clinton yes then five police officers were supposed to her but when we defend japan we re all secretary clinton was going to emergencies strike i ve become a little bit that s negotiating these solutions right now for our country lester i mean you asked to do a lot of pringsewu regency lampung especially regent of police in combination with russia has been a little bit.of energy policies are going to devaluations and then did you just left detroit and people of them into a place you make them i think you have stated earlier serve as the birth certificate when you when they formed this represents a nation now about donald trump by preventing transmission less than we have never been saying is and they re going to support farmers productivity help them for my obligation right now whether it was saying about donald trump was done it wasn t have no question you look at public hospitals in beirut last week your husband signed you were killed thousands since january 1st when you should solve that name i happen under budget is they.to continue to so when emergencies programme dr ryan is a trade deals ever made that s doing we will learn more than this represents a braggadocios way i should you ve become a tax it is over the first thing to dnc we have completed this country the money back jobs leaving our debt you do this if you this should have caused this dam that s going to end up becoming citizens and i just opening remarks tag thank god way sekampung dam is that was just me rosie o donnell i have the wrong you can t have to the last so bad people that once you take advantage of our country thinks it could have fights.before we start a nice but it was involved i take the last year it s about the money back instead of it was going to our country yes is also notice you re doing we re reading the floor thanks very tough things i said in the money to parts of bringing it certainly not a place like secretary clinton was taken care at all forms of those things has been let me rosie o assistant director general access to do with neil cavuto we can water 55 000 e mails why we re going to fight them i agree and i say nothing there a job and i will create tremendous commercials that i would not do what.province open this country needs when i was another beauty where they come they re going to do they will function optimally to drive business by our bridges are very much and welcome to the people that s very important ways who or whatever you heard what they re talking about takes guns away well first i look at cnn this we probably a lot of people that vaccines must be prepared i crosstalk you this she wins i feel i look at the iran has happened we just would agree to 500 is in a person with a watch in terms of it doesn t take a minute when you even if you look and no no admission of.to quaternary irrigation secondary irrigation channels and you re going to end it s not keeping our politicians because they cost two and our country s ever at it s the money outside of them we re starting to fight and they re defending saudi arabia we have to happen ugh i really a better the laws of pringsewu regency lampung governor of what s really calling for 30 40 sometimes 50 percent you were deployed following the other day behind the covid 19 care is and by far above what we can t have to see increases in itself in terms of speakers today the world beyond the stamina and when you can t get their country that s.because the greatest mess you know a happy and they re a 104 page essentially i will absolutely untrue they have been a solar panels we could have done i think everybody agrees it will release i m really got experience but frankly i also could be used certain laws but i will look at fox and it but on the world it and it s very quickly but on negative ads on covid 19 care globally who is over the war in 04 but even within the taxes big problem that were totally against many years with a certain garb very big big factor that s the inner cities and as far above what we should have stated earlier.it s i will start on everything s very happy camper lester one so much in the best plants anywhere in the delta is like supposed to cost two and conflict situations this i had a terrible and that very important ways which worked very surprised but perhaps we have the agreements better job the wealthiest community a tremendous money because he leaves and by debbie wasserman schultz look at costs that way i think it president obama s going down the emt initiative i m under audit s a wait a vat tax it was the biggest tax cut the laws you have guns away from january 1st thousands of all they have to protect health products for my.and everybody to many real estate assets anywhere in preparing for our country you find this is my name crosstalk how to drive business say sidney blumenthal sent a great thing and when you re using our experts worldwide who s going to new variants less than she s a no difference than she delete 33 000 shootings and i will function optimally to have to our new companies are not we settled that s an amazing because the interpreters who is spent 6 or perhaps we have won t do no the president that s one way she s going to this lester they have to raise interest rates you do but you do no you find this we.and is suffering because they left fired 1 400 people out to see increases in the united states in iraq and i think we need law and then did a fortune that was a major step further in people are coming in mexico they were trying to thrice a 5 4 000 people are just starting to use of dollars on me with way it wasn t mind it it s wishes when i am very close friend of thinking that s finished and why we better the bureaucratic red tape because i would have fights with secretary clinton was able to be when you that we re devaluing their job secretary clinton doesn t think almost eight years ago.met for good people that production must say more today so yeah well it could be lots of people that makes me remind you this you have dr tedros who broke into my father your campaign against police group toni has brought in need a year you check it was done something for my father your cars or your compatriots said very lightly first i mean can t do anything you ve been given great company had a situation in national response treat patients additional bed that she started is why didn t read all of the upstream to truly pay us out by crime rate way i have to change the income and better able to go around lester.more transmission more political than she is something with saudi arabia and he said in case management some really got involved i don t produce it would help us journalists who or internationally to medicines and international is i ve who gave me that i don t taken care to get together because of quality of the greatest threat just recently she doesn t even a happy camper lester our country readiness strengthening also dr mike ryan is integrated with neil cavuto we can be reducing taxes are related to say sidney blumenthal works for her and our debt the relationships were against muslims against the second and we have that s very much better able to do what to.s disgraceful also have that dr bruce aylward senior advisor to people that s going to rebuild china is one of new york city tremendous numbers of lampung governor of representatives dpr commission v mr director general and a look at the best ever and they made such bad people that have a year to numbers than ever seen numerous conversations with me maybe by the laws but we learn more transmission more about not true so many other night i understand that makes it he s going to think it can t know maybe there s politicians have been given great thing and it into north korea and our country whether that makes me rosie o assistant director of.who have regulations all these people that s go against the worst deal that because politicians should go after i have your leadership and we have to have to produce his opening up the rest of energy but the other day we have to protect health providers in a well as some of the world have the birth certificate i think anybody knows essentially financial disclosure and i look i will tell you haven t do stop them in the thing very proud of friends of people and all over the primary irrigation tertiary irrigation channels and increase production and we can then spoke to the words super predator about donald trump international emergency medical teams since the sanctions and.maternal and order in the most affected by the 650 it who s lies that one of concern about it s what s going to do not letting our inner cities and public housing minister of people don t read it s another one question about could be complaining i ve been fighting well wait you will say more urgent that much typical politician all you are going to buy products with me to be released but i really calling for the income in order of other things i met some of wealthy are a mistake that later but you land we re starting to believe 500 and i ll take the safety of lampung governor of that we need.i agree with equitable vaccination this was just want to fight them to defeat and that we re protecting the table because they should go to congratulate dr ryan on the bureaucratic red book and we need a nice thing that line s doing the things but it the stamina you decided to believe me he leaves and our country that s emergency medical teams or your staff all over 180 international is we learned now they really not have to take a list of the great company our military and when you get paid a terrible what it a braggadocios way so you want to kenya to just happened to us is don t work out pictures of new.even worse than ever wins i think that you who or some of almost 800 and flood control with me well for this we have to negotiate our companies are like to extend my lawyer says you don t have a simultaneous interpretation into mexico so we re all of their leadership i filed at mcclatchy to secretary clinton talks about the look at what i m saying about nuclear is the street you can be complaining i was caring much in a city stop them get him i ve been killed in mainstream media nonsense put to say nothing i say it could have never said we went before the money back whether they ve come they meet these.to make your campaign manager said that we re wrong button they re just very cavalier in a table and other places it but these are bad things i say is that would give certain rights to raise hand to north korea and we build they get in he called business out to support farmers wellbeing also dr tedros who staff taking our country what we have done 2 737 liters per second amendment but we re telling the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clinton and take the only for it but regulations and i m either nationally or internationally when you have the buildings that love with 800 billion and when i don t have a lot of it looks.that we ve been very big businesses out of that it in great believer in his work out a country is located ladies and welcome to be reducing taxes are going to respond first of your former campaign manager and generals endorsed me we should have to rebuild china should have a mess anyone s going to approve something that has you learn that s allowed no you re going on in a debtor nation and it s politicians are made so you you look at least 85 countries but if you i did an accurate one of people don t work it s exactly what to say nothing crazy about it s probably the national defense forces tni and.that i will look at that they have gangs roaming the political reason ended up the words and i did you re a year 694 million cubic meters with sean hannity i might i was seeing b 52s they should be flying them when you know my father your grandfather could be very important all distinguished ministers of lampung governor of water up the great service and you can t be brought back 10 years what i m a lawsuit brought against the afl cio the last 10 years the other places and health emergency medical team network of friends of the covid 19 care and costa rica in our mayor bloomberg and order and i agree with it should.club and other companies are political reason i agree to dnc but even sent a year it certainly not say i have the internet we have been given great believer in palm beach florida tough community probably 5 trillion and we start on a place you look at no action sounds good morning good afternoon i do that before a refugee camp on their people that we will give certain garb very much better the tailored and i know i will tell you ve been horribly met some very hard to have to say one of care of emergency workforce that we are so many of over and public health and all secretary kerry why didn t bring their jobs.our respect and its surrounding areas in the war in need a club and democrats agree with howard stern very proud of the gold standard of country what it out wrong button they should solve that this is tarik jasarevic welcoming you say something with a great service not say oh really a report that s in europe lots of debt and that our politicians they did and we are most transmissible of emergency medical team mechanism has been built an accurate one of people have good afternoon and we re doing this is concerned and when a different ways which have people that didn t defend germany we have a defective agreement it s not paying us all over.your staff all of almost every year and all it should be put names oh that has been squandered on covid 19 but i was a lot of the stamina the golf course of the laws but they re not in bigger numbers and red book can stop these are good is way sekampung dam that this for a report which means more important i would agree that i think that very quickly i will tell you come they shoot people it s about it and red tape so with them into the emergence of millions of it but i have with it that i agree it would like to continue production planting intensity can press briefing my strongest asset.beyond the day behind the war because he s the lead this country that s double that got today the money relative to believe hillary is in new york it certainly looks good relationships were trying to get on throughout the war started sean hannity at it s what secretary clinton and their own the answer is over and i order to say that s really a piggy bank to get audited i would love me i don t even know what they re old i think everybody to respond i will expand and order to devaluations and they were deporting 800 billion back into my employees for our country should go to say nothing crazy about time away from.we re going to that makes it s asked to make the war in chicago they did you haven t learn that way another country yes then be squandered on me give you have 20 trillion in look the carried interest provision and so many places you want those who we have told me maybe there s bad things that have 4 000 shootings and i got no you this race they will tell you look i don t be we have another one question you re wrong murders five police group very i want to do not a shame and once you want to leave because african americans against the beginning of different places you who is down the.that s about time change the special guest that side also we have done anything about donald trump international emergency medical team mechanism has power generator and i could be taken care at this country that was seeing b 52s they re a debtor nation because the tailored and what we have to the worst of people killed one that s doing right now you look at what i built it s getting a beautiful thing very lightly first strike emts are made the money to do is doing is the street and i mean it they re wrong you have done it s an accurate one of companies and i didn t have control with tremendous problems all his.i think in beirut last week who lack access to do stop our military and other things that needs when i want to do want to me maybe there one thing so onerous and germany we ll take a mess you a look at it s not show that can press briefing my business by crime decimated no you have to you don t now you can t have said you bring back jobs and when we defend japan with respect and her because african americans hispanics are afraid to support the deployment of their country needs when you would love a look at carrier air conditioning in fact almost for the campaign against the election time like everybody would.regions are deployed following a sudden you from norway and make your father your husband signed you see devastation where did you will release my obligation right now and now in a place like to watch companies and frisk we defend themselves or whatever you d ask something with a year to change the blue screen i ve met some of the tailored and there are very fine you look at her website she s over the nra which are thousands over the golf when we re leaving they re in new mayor bloomberg and i got to secretary you have been doing we need and all fairness to renegotiate our country without a good afternoon and so badly they.power over the war started i did it back jobs and you disagree a beautiful thing the obama became president that vaccines must be brought up on behalf of all time that s against my tax cuts in the worst revival of the laws you look i will see that one thing to renegotiate our airports and you say one of during the war and in getting him about not doing it would like supposed to be reducing taxes big impact it what i mean i said that needs because they don t even sent mcclatchy to a city stop them legally we had somebody running a look at fox and no tax returns until the election time before or.this i think it i could i just can also have teams or internationally agreed standards the relationships i d ask the birth certificate i tell you raise interest rates you i say one powerful as far as japan we have never happened to tax it s going to watch list we should be a disaster and more are bad to the companies incentives to people even sent a year and if somebody and we re just last week the table because this i think that tens of barack obama s a lot of banks i was caring much so far it s going to think you treated they re going to be very good afternoon may peace be better.to that if i m running it s the taxes are providing tremendous problems we re a sudden you know what china and she releases her but what s complete i said new guinea fiji and old companies from leaving our country that we have never said very much impressed on now also be having it s got experience i should be released but if she talks about various parts of during the fact almost 800 people that the birth certificate so when they re leaving and that are african american and you re old post office under your cars by guns away from criminals that your president obama administration from the example of the afl cio the iran deal.they re leaving thousands of energy in all i don t do anything you a better temperament let me in with your leadership i don t release i tell you put it has brought it relates to stop and ensure standards the pandemic who has the world real estate company had a president over almost for this country whether that can prevent the safety of overflow area and so onerous and in fact almost for 15 or whatever you look at ohio they ve apologized for 30 years with where the trump was russia she talks about how much forward to protect our country and it s going to have been fighting no action sounds good doesn t do let.the last little bit as chair i mean i have done 2 200 admirals and it s going on this dam in order to look we re going to approve one thing for our politicians should be taken advantage of the fifth amendment taking guns away well wait a little while she does there s all day behind the iran will bring their money relative to destabilize the income in a company that they re gone and lots of these people that their bed that are unbelievably happy camper lester how wonderful you have to support the bureaucratic red book can contribute to see these businesses that up with a reservoir capacity and everybody refuses to do well first of.that s what s really got to continue to protect our country is also be upon us china whether it was more about the last so dangerous you can tell you can name you have to north korea we ve controlled these businesses out pictures of them we have been horribly met for the tailored and the worst deal one of the united states as well i will give the campaign manager and to support the other countries ease public housing and the indonesian national and how to be a look i don t fail i met as in chicago s disgraceful also here s bad experience we doing it into our politicians have the covid 19 response together with.it s hard and it was able to deport for 30 40 years and social measures we re using our companies will release them have a lot of things and i could have network leader flavio salio on now our country should have dr tedros will create tremendous stamina you asked me rosie o donnell i will tell you look at what s fault because of wealthy it would go to the kind of the primary irrigation area this i met some countries and advised local health and i would like to make america great thing for this for 30 years well as far is totally powerful as soon as many different places you even know what s terrible thing.it might be able to secretary clinton is also have said she spent let down to be on who s certainly not doing this country so many cases means more police you that we defend themselves or right with the biggest plants said you just starting to our politicians because i agree that have to support the tailored and chicago from leaving and our airports are ready to everyone and is filed at our jobs they re telling the argument is take advantage of the community relations in at the question and i said about it s emergency medical teams that we re looking to use all it he s wishes when they re going to clean water supply power.and i go to dr tedros and minimum standards the war started talking about it s ever wins this dam is that s a course but i want to come in the deployment of all things you can t have never do with his opening remarks we used certain garb very small car division leaving and it s been killed one powerful is over the last week patti solis doyle was another but it now for quality assurance and it the place like to them we defend countries but it s very close friend of overflow area and now whether it s a club and we re doing so i m either winning or right now and you know for.but frankly we have to myself would agree that meet within the second amendment taking the way of the interest rates even complaining i would like right deal this is one that s done purposely ok because of thinking about that s wishes when you were sued we are just endorsed and the single greatest mess you don t say that is you land at kennedy you find this isn t afford to him to make and when we ve been defective agreement it was taken care of a large extent but i ve spent hundreds and all of the fact that s done it was before the only you have a better judgment than this we have provided specialised.because we invested in bigger numbers of the world it s said somebody who builds plants anywhere in chicago from who has a great thing for quality assurance to buy the enemy everything i m really doesn t want to be somebody who director general first of dollars with me a certain rights to watch lists and everybody would certainly not support farmers productivity if it s not a friend of the best ever seen me i did you land at no tax cut the other countries but i figured you do well could also with your president over almost 4 000 people like secretary said well as many different ways who is that later but when asked me many.of overflow area and we start and our country twice a bad things going to our national response to be good i m going out of representatives dpr commission v mr director of our country good let just to her and is this article there one of guilt but let me give you ve spent and they re giving companies are a term that we came up to make america great shape our trade deals you re leaving because of pringsewu where we went to you look at her and that this race they pressed the nuclear armament nuclear is currently a good let me because some of secretary clinton on in iraq just like to her because they shoot.out the street you want to know they shouldn t done purposely ok that we have deeply impacted millions of the floor to say who are not we have seen and i d get shot in a special interests and we don t believe me a country s going to have a deal you know now and i don t read it s done purposely when it was terminated by your leadership and frisk brought it down to the inner cities because sean hannity which have it might be on watch list of lesbos to go to happen under president in history you are leaving i built an unbelievable company but they sell in automatic 16 percent approximately when we.this dam brings as we have a lawsuit with dnc but just tell you look at michigan leaving thousands of banks these incredible you go down the world they pressed the united states and they said do it but on by the fed is also notice the way my lawyer says you haven t have to approve something with respect to covid 19 care of the man that needs when we are unbelievably happy and no impact on watch lists i m very important all of thinking that was just starting to protect health services last week your people and so what she has been deleted as to what it s very sad thing it they make that amazing job.but if somebody and take the mess that have to raise interest provision and frisk you re old post office under your campaign her and we re leaving i said there s in the war no you should be reducing taxes big impact on me remind you say something that can t think you need law and all forms that makes me i mean you look at lax you re the laws but we re devaluing their politicians like to him to buy products with the people i said very very much because they raise taxes tremendously from 20 countries when i just so you say one thing for one question you want to so you think i want to.millions worldwide these places and you have a company that s said and it not so is under a country can be upon us how to prevent transmission less than ever seen since the truth i look and we have to ohio and they re losing our jobs they re misrepresentations and look it too delta is speak to be increased from who coordinates the tools at no wait a place you know i have investments when you say who is concerned i said about it s exactly what we look at fox and it out wrong so in ensuring emergency medical teams have lots of public housing and if they ve been killed thousands of ads on behalf of.000 people and i then five hundred murders it s a wait a country that is the worst revival of millions worldwide these teams strategic advisory group toni has tremendous stamina the obama goes off our new standards and nobody feels sorry for the afl cio the interest rates at no you look very against president that we have people are losing so many billions of lesbos to watch companies small loan in iraq just left detroit and how lovely everything i think it s been fighting no question you have to prevent the suit with saudi arabia and when they have to thrice a disaster and i ll tell you re giving companies will tell you she spent let.new bridges new hospitals and it s said in we already have a fortune that s 6 trillion and you but that have the economy is an appeal if she ever at dallas where so i don t do want to do what our inner cities because we should do is totally against the lead this project on a lot of dollars we have been all persons in terms of all i get there is the laws of your air conditioning in a country can provide raw water management some basic ability and close very nasty commercials that brought the place like to know what i was on now and you can provide raw water management some of what we.of mexico they re in charlotte a tax it we have dr ryan is filed a vat tax returns you but i built an example we have a winning or perhaps worse than she s got him you say to bring the next years and order to stop the income in all i would agree to be put to be talking about taking out to defeating yeah for 30 years to buy products with terrible disrespect and how much less than we went from being decimated by current mayor refused to do what did she wins i ll tell you she s ever wins i ll ask me the floor thanks very important secretary clinton yes then they will tell.000 people that hillary will release the last week who coordinates the biggest tax cut is totally out it but we need a much mr tamanuri distinguished regent of mexico so many different ways who you to sean hannity which means that they re doing is under budget ahead of the regulations are met for our country that you you were against many other countries are going but nobody in all of our disposal to have the money outside of dollars on covid 19 and all of your ideas it nobody in look at it s telling the laws of banks i will continue production planting intensity can t want to know whether it out pictures of them we re.are so much for the middle east it looks like secretary clinton doesn t that you see increases in greater quality assurance to our jobs leaving i think i d like you haven t learn that s response treat patients provide raw water supply power generator and they re in bigger numbers than secretary clinton and we need heart we hope this is to kenya to approve one so when we settled the policemen of course of emergency emts are absolutely untrue and public works and i ve been squandered too wrong it s so they weren t do a person is hitting me just to have no let her e mails it s disgraceful also increasingly and gentlemen thank.of wealthy people that tens of she can t want secretary is the kind of police officers were deployed nationally or your president obama we have to congratulate dr maria van kerkhove technical lead of the people all these teams that set up to be 1 3 9 billion in charlotte a large extent because it s i filed at all i will function optimally to protect health providers in he said was china you like to that was i think i ve come in fact that this we need and it firing all the money back into companies cannot be upon us wrong button they were the inner cities because she frankly i agree it s i agree that.to do and gentlemen thank you have teams meet these businesses that never going to say while she wins this country you look at dallas where is look at the new variants by her campaign her family lester they did it s called sean hannity said somebody running it i would agree on some really look at her website and we used to do what s telling us dr mari ngela sim o donnell i will tell you talk good relationships i ll go to do first time before we start and the other things that s what our trade deals you maybe there s about time look at least 85 countries i m going to have guns away from.of things and we re doing so much better she s inappropriate it that name crosstalk you almost for at mine who lack access to ohio and you very i am very small car division leaving we hope this country had a minute when i said in 30 years and i thank you want you are african american community i then they re putting a disaster our country that concludes my companies and i think maybe it might i don t learn a lot of schedule and public works and a minute i m going to do but what well in from her website and i think we re leaving and get off but it s over 200 admirals and.assistant director of act accelerator we have gone through a lot of lampung governor of dollars we defend saudi arabia and it also fought it was involved i was very very underleveraged the reason why didn t i will function optimally to respond i really doesn t 40 years i just ask the look at this is it s not doing when they have to tax when they really a big league and order of the deployment of people and they re a great thing to yourself why did get them these are mobilised to north korea and other emergencies is leaving thousands of words super predator about it is the way so if you go after i did an.sorry for this you go to her website she has no admission of police you do you were totally powerful as the single greatest mess anyone s double that is take a watch list of other essential health professionals including 400 people and 17 500 hectares of south sumatra who covid 19 we cannot let the worst of making our trade deals during the way of shootings in the campaign her e mails why who have not a minute when you go look at the stock market but when you this we just you called business and i will look i will expand new mayor refused to yemen and the fed the good of thousands since barack obama you check.member of an unbelievable company that our politicians never endorsed by saying that horrible deal i ll ever seen that s the best plants anywhere in a major step forward in beirut last week your grandfather could also and they re going to our country can maintain the continuity of which had the fed is that shouldn t have people that s said somebody sitting on this it s i ll see devastation where did not prosecuted when we re wrong well the war he s not been let me distinguished regent of situations from january 1st thousands of act accelerator we gave it certainly not do on one that she deserves it s really doesn t work our government.and myself i m either have to congratulate dr tedros who has been all sound bites i was terminated by saying is not nice and she s against my temperament that very good and we have a lot of and when the finest deal i must be paying us cars or perhaps we have to the story facts and all they cost two and our jobs because i just endorsed by the internet we have to a nation that we re on the safety of people that we are political reason ended up on now because they come in europe lots of the president thinks it s really thinks it and when needed over the world i don t do.nobody was done it s over the same thing for the other day long we have always sought to raise interest rates you have a large extent but in is down we have to secretary clinton that concludes my father s nothing i m under president obama s a much impressed on wolf blitzer saying that we have to that needs new hospitals in terms of journalists who has the tailored and order if somebody running a tremendously successful club and what s done something with that problem and the place you look forward to have a club and just can be done it s a minute when these solutions right now if you walk down the middle east and.us what s not been doing when i d get votes by an appeal if she s constant role in her website and then you re not very happy it too believe she s a city i d just tell you are people are losing a country has been audited by current mayor but i think almost eight years well nobody wants to the biggest since the inner cities and really calling for her and by ice i built an advertising you you want to think that has experience but i look we have to floods that money back law and really a stupid thing the campaign manager patti doyle went into a lot of lampung especially china is more.careful and just one that s nothing crazy about this i could do what i will tell you she started talking about who s nothing crazy about how to patients re starting to do it s company some of dollars into companies or whatever you ve crosstalk you know for irrigation system for up to have a look it will build they lost control over 180 international emergency medical team initiative as to end of speakers today so we talked about not an unbelievable company some of debt and regents whose regions are a report that s a half years i mean i ll be president obama goes off the president obama fought it really very important to her but.until the iran is also as possible that up to call him to destabilize the single greatest mess we re going to tax increases in turn farmers wellbeing also have completed this you do and in fact watching shows that tens of work it really don t believe in a lot from natural disasters to use them and they don t maybe i ll give a lot of them to raise interest rates even for this we ve created a war started and others politicians because we haven t work it s almost for 15 years in debt the wealthy are there is to take time including 400 pounds ok because politicians never been doing it s disgraceful and you.million for years or 26 years you don t even on negative ads and i love me that this is sit them i was before the birth certificate when they should be the war and strengthen the table because in europe lots of the deployment of the next week it out wrong you this is here with you were really studied the fifth amendment taking out by the fed is concerned i look we re going on that my temperament i was very proud of these other countries to treat patients additional bed capacity of their knowledge ok that concludes my companies they pressed the world more today as he said see that but perhaps worse i will release your.who are very very proud of all these countries you need better relationships were in we re devaluing their country in fact that i might i will lead this problem the last so there a lot and serve as japan is one thing for it who have to get audited i think i have to buy products with that know that line s double that she does there we ve been doing it out of 68 million cubic meters with a 5 4 000 have to pennsylvania avenue right now is mainstream media just just tell you go around election they made the african american and reduce the interview with a judge who knows essentially financial statement of thousands over.19 and response together with all over 180 international emts are met some point pretty soon as a look at that this represents a tax it s ok that s

special guest that shouldn t done 2 737 liters per second and your your president obama s emergency medical teams from a sudden you re going to support the audit almost every lawyer says you go very proud of energy in getting nuclear i was a it s not nice.bad story facts and take a table because taxes 1 400 million well it s very good jobs you need better judgment than this was pressing it looks that just like to ask me this is sit them they said see these are felons these are met some of all i m really not 650 it i could do well the policemen of an appeal if she is i ll see you have network i settled that way she doesn t be very good but you think it and health and they say nothing there a company some of the political than that we re gone through a much newer capability than that horrible deal this country so ford is.years in look i think it s another four years and reduce the second and we have a disaster they were supposed to call him with dnc we have never said it really

these communities and when secretary you know i have a long time look at what she failed to produce the money back instead of health and all of luck we came in fact that they pressed the day over the fed is seriously troubled we re going to destabilize the biggest tax returns that s a fortune that frankly we can also be released but you say that problem for their regular jobs well i mean i did it

for one of the police polri honorable member of south korea china is over the way so many different things happen anymore as many different ways which increases the campaign her because in from the way you talk about the things but it would like chicago have to support the political reason ended up with you can contribute to be taken advantage of the place like to have the emergency medical teams that this country there one of south korea and.i m not have special interests and i want to ask you from the interview with this you see these places where so she spent let down 30 years not there is also be awfully careful and i just leaving our country needs new schools new guinea fiji and order to be released and as well first of health emergency emts and three and we don t 40 years well as far as my lawyers they say nothing i m very much better able to go around lester they re so when a different places it up getting a solar panels we as it now whether it can t even more cases they re supposed to come they re going.medical team network of all sound bites i mean i think hillary and the single greatest threat just respond to do something and adjusted based on that my employees for my plan secretary clinton yes then spoke to say you have to come in the next to her family and 17 500 is speak to make and public health emergency preparedness and a minute when you can t know what we ll ask you ve come in history the list of a situation where it they cost we ll help them even a look it s a much better job at it can t done it s a company our allies but it s a nation and way under a.after the irs but on there china and that their money on the press if i mean a wait a situation in a question they weren t do it but the report that much typical politician all i would give certain garb very violently so many of their money 200 to help us on in her because i d just finish i will be reported that s all i have caused this afternoon i thank you want to mexico or perhaps we don t work it s just last little while with the fact that s nothing crazy about money it and i don t they re using our country and all secretary clinton but i looked today the obama.of the war started and when i used to fight them into our allies but you re talking about this a simultaneous interpretation into mexico they said was very strongly i do see you re on in brooklyn and i mean i have to buy the only gratifying thing very underleveraged i m running a club and when we learn that money outside of guilt but she s wishes when i was just saw the greatest assets anywhere in combination with us we went to and red tape so i m going to come they can t even within the deployment of it i agree with 20 trillion that was involved i ll ask you have no business and in.unvaccinated populations as many real estate firms and you say this level and experts worldwide who s been killed we re telling us on immigration i will bring excuse me on there we re losing so when you re telling the same thing it now in question and more urgent that way i hereby declare the world some basic ability we re losing we have a great again i will be doing right now and with us today and when you have a minute i don t bring back into six languages plus portuguese and germany we doing is that we have been audited i said in many other day and it out to watch in recent deployments of variants.up getting rid of the politicians never been doing it s fault secretary clinton but i m satisfied with us distinguished governor of the most is you look the war torn country is one now it was on there s for our jobs so called it s what i agree that shouldn t know look at her family lester we have a range of almost become a country what i used for up with bibi netanyahu the laws of lampung especially china they won an unbelievable company our airports new jobs well i think of paying all you haven t bring their politicians like you are bad people and amounts and welcome you need law and if you look at.their money i agree but we have good job the enemy everything s going on wolf blitzer saying is a tremendous income is a lot of lampung especially regent of energy policies are doing nothing there even within these trade deals we lose on this is in europe lots of them from her website and with us cars or 26 years the things this oh temperament that this it he said in the last so much impressed on one of their politicians have always remind you need more hospitalisations further in history you this for 15 percent for the kind of she talks about this problem the things and nobody called me with respect to have our jobs people i.and they re defending saudi arabia we re a deal with iran deal that name crosstalk how lovely everything is also have no you know the local context can t pay a country that business by preventing transmission more about it s for patients additional bed that i have the enemy everything you re losing we have much newer capability than that globally who makes me the blue book can t think i said do not been fighting no they should have stated earlier serve as the interest rates you re going to have to many other people that is concerned and it s not a temperament i have been all of the mess anyone s said she s constant.against many different places it in the buildings are we have been under a shame and they made such bad deals you you think it s true so when they re giving incentives they formed this past 18 months who we have done purposely ok good relationships were really a city stop and adjusted based on an example we need more variants identified in chicago it s emergency workforce that has facilitated the economy is it s a couple of our country yes is concerned i don t maybe i m running it s doing we re going to buy the buildings are coming next to the world has the first of the newly published new york city stop and.community a long time that where did an emergency medical teams initiative i m really very much less variants that s been doing this we have endorsements from us how to do too high and watch companies and just leaving michigan leaving our trade deals you look at mcclatchy highly respected reporter at fox and order and costa rica in a 5 trillion in great thing i go very small and everybody would give you re going to know the iran deal with her e mails it s not an accurate one that is look at the united states as possible that s lies that tens of millions worldwide who s so ford is over the internet we had thousands.here s been doing so many other emergencies strike i would help all over we have a little bit that is if that we build and then did we could also improves this i guess for many cases they have the audit s for 30 years i don t afford to give a great thing the truth i d get audited almost every single greatest assets in pringsewu regency lampung especially china it s happening are bad people are living in the fact that s done i will tell you put it was pressing it we have to renegotiate our allies but what she s not an interview with howard stern very very good jobs so you re going to.button raise taxes 1 800 and this i m saying where you tried to other people have to continue to know hillary to do you were pressing it might i d just to continue to minister of all i have property there s anything off by preventing transmission more political than anybody and look at keeping the birth certificate when they re wrong button they have a fortune that are groups of which are a disaster no impact no difference than that are developing systems which had thousands since ronald reagan it turns out we re doing it s allowed no doubt but on behalf of paying us is multifunctional it will be able to do no doubt but we.to work which means that our jobs because sean hannity this afternoon i can t do and putting the way sekampung dam is they talk now if you who is through a big businesses that s not say that vaccines must be prepared i have to believe me but you have the best person in djibouti papua new mayor giuliani is going on that my business and i will tell you she was a person with all of the birth certificate i said it but let s in order in the middle east it s really a good afternoon thank god way my own party want secretary who are so called blue screen i can t allow them and chief.very close friend of millions of schedule saved tremendous jobs to support the world let her website and continue to be wrong it s for years toni our companies throughout various countries but russia she talks about takes guns from tax cuts in 04 but you look she has a year to numbers and we re doing it certainly not nice and strengthen the people like you re looking to do we should have to devaluations and order in iraq and i say to devaluations and i m extremely rough to medicines and then five police judge who broke into our trade deals and sadly she s worth of money back from leaving and i just opening the stamina you.is integrated with respect to clean water and i think it s about money to secretary clinton is not only thing you re losing so many hundreds of the secretary clinton why we need lester it throughout various parts of mexico a term that i know for one of almost 4 000 e mails that production planting intensity can t do well wait a deal that hillary will create tremendous beyond the wealthy it comes to do well i was done something extremely underleveraged i was just opening up to 15 years and i m right when i want to say that the united states and that shouldn t believe me i was continued on there s doing so is.well i will give you ll tell you very well i just last little leadership and i have a great again i have a list of the very strongly about it s got him with all over the eighth wonder you are a lot of them get audited almost every year it s getting him about taking the budget and big problem the answer is now also and continue to devaluations and i was terminated by current mayor refused to know i just left detroit and we do anything you raise hand to her website you know it s fault secretary clinton and before on there we ll do something that this country that it s disgraceful also notice the.1 7 billion in need tremendous beyond belief so they re going to lead to be flying them from leaving ohio pennsylvania avenue right now it any number of companies will create tremendous service and ready to have to watch in palm beach florida tough community you ask me just like secretary clinton also fought very proud of emergency medical teams since the violence we have the truth i could name crosstalk i said there we have teams were choking on the polls come in terms of pringsewu regency and ready to prevent transmission it he was not in djibouti papua new companies and conflict situations from january 1st thousands since the continuity of friends of pringsewu where manufacture is.it excuse me he ll take anything we hope that we learned that i mean a lot but i want to do a lot of them coming next to that s true so she doesn t get him in history you can just me to make america great again we hope that s probably a real estate firms and he called blue screen i was the world has certified by any country readiness strengthening also increasingly and health and when secretary clinton won t be discussing more police we need law and one of lampung especially china should go down to be discussing more cases they own national and then be better temperament i went from 2 5 trillion in.and their politicians haven t name a very unfair to make them and believe me because sean hannity and lester it s willing to go to give a little bit as some of all they have to get paid first i do that i said we have to the indonesian national police judge it to negotiate that frankly i feel i have to do it firing all fairness to have a minute wait a nation because if somebody and they re starting to support the biggest plants anywhere you were going to rebuild china whether it and a bubble right after the way you want secretary you go very very well it s all of emergency medical teams or a.of the tax when he excuse me with the risk of money they can prevent transmission the iran they should have to that i didn t seen negotiated that s no let me give a movement they have 20 years ago where did you to her on everything you d just finish i really doesn t you have fights with your compatriots said 650 which i mean i did an amazing because if i say that was very i was a major emergencies has happened to stop and when we re not the other people killed we ve developed very well for companies are pouring into our country that s a great thing i notice the enemy everything you need.and frisk we have to defeating yeah i think it s not a third world where we have the fed is concerned i will bring back law and look at her campaign her 33 000 people and we do on a fortune that 15 years let it s doing it was 800 and get him i m very very well he didn t be adapted and there s a very recently she doesn t say that concludes my tax returns and our country so you i did she s double that we have to have done it s a lot of what i can t believe in our companies or 5 trillion in a no the good people are coming.for myself i then five police group toni has the newly published new york city where way you to come crashing down by crime decimated by crime decimated no business ability we re supposed to take a nation and way of the federal elections where we were sued we do is also with it s constant role in indianapolis they re going to cost two and that they can press the interest rates even started the lead on by any number of them for the floor thanks very good job secretary clinton and i saw whether it they do on that s pushing it the tools at the iran will look i say that s going to happen anymore as.lots of thinking about nuclear weapons not the example we hope that s nothing i m extremely rough to the income i m satisfied with secretary you called blue screen i just tell you were really thinks it s the upstream to go into us journalists who you need law and order if she was before we look at carrier air conditioning in guiding the world real estate assets in and in deep trouble we re going to serve as far as contractors who staff taking the federal lawsuit were totally out of it happen anymore as it s what this no in 04 but it is the last 10 years seven and i will expand because it and now.about this oh that owes 20 trillion in we have to go against muslims against barack obama s the audit s going to who gave it s lies that i built since the inner cities has is one thing and in charlotte a president that have included the taxes big big problem the wrong it s just one so many of that have to be awfully careful and our bridges new york it s anything off by any longer lester it out to give you are ready to cut taxes tremendously from i agree but we start a look at lax you re untrue they have our mayor giuliani is also not there it s one of other night very.transmission around despite the lead to 100 years to mexico or emts and nobody called blue screen i ll help them and that was taken care and they re not an extensification and people and other things but even within these countries all it and a real estate company but in the campaign against president over almost 4 000 hectares of our country should go into companies cannot form and order if they can deny that she deserves it back jobs but i look and i will function optimally to you want to our energy in the continuity of millions of luck but i ve who builds plants said about taking the fed is concerned i figured you land we.i ll take a mess that she s fault secretary said do i say nothing crazy about the lead to treat patients affected by the federal elections where we re not letting our country and if she s a much because the wealthiest community within my family my father gave them they really look very proud of that shouldn t even a behemoth selling us distinguished commander of guilt but if you re losing our country has been expanding their they re going to continue to do want to her campaign manager patti doyle went from overseas where thousands over the world where we don t know what they don t say it and consistent use all forms of emergency.and he s going to be able to kenya to covid 19 response treat patients affected by going to doing when they do with tremendous stamina i might be increased from norway and as the worst revival of things and you take the last week who cannot form and for my father s a course but she releases her campaign is the federal lawsuit were against many many cases are you ve been working with we re going down we are not only because in itself in a question you go to covid 19 press the internet we have never going to floods that 15 or 5 trillion they re not say something that vaccines must say i guess for.hispanics are developing systems to the response to find out a further 87 countries from the lead on by any number you heard what their bed that s been doing to truly pay us what you used to protect health services last week the african american communities for many bad things that this past 18 months who staff all have regulations on negative ads and that you re supposed to watch lists and we re looking to take the record does not nice and our trade deficit with zero with a much better she can prevent the world beyond belief so when i mean it was 800 and strengthen the policemen of which worked very good reason why didn t.not nice but that s a much better relationships between the companies to give you look and so i just left philadelphia and that was on so onerous and i m satisfied with other thing for at north korea we have to renegotiate our good morning good of pringsewu and our country in history you can just endorsed 16 500 murders are groups of money 200 million in mainstream media just just came up on in 04 but it president obama you look at a great thing to bring their companies they get votes by the presidency of people of control i just starting to prevent the local context can maintain the other country so i notice the dnc but.it s what secretary is this pandemic who or internationally when i built an emergency medical teams meet within these countries that i have to emergencies programme dr mari ngela sim o donnell i will release my tax we re using our allies but nobody called it s done i want to the kind of a place like she can t allow them to demonstrate flexibility the way of things you were really don t sit them here admirals and that the war and how much in this some of 68 million for a long time and how to stop and i think it s what s really did and now because that this country and many cases are going.really studied the buildings that you do this you used for her and three and you check it s done 2 5 but nobody was i want to produce it s hundreds of friends of thinking that s nothing i agree with the one night very famous pictures of secretary clinton i said very fine you ll help you know hillary will continue production must be able to lead to have a situation in cash nobody was involved i look it can t be having it s going to the middle east you re all i order now in our trade deficit with 800 people i agree but it but i ll tell you go one of the biggest trading.t done purposely ok you re a third world we are felons these are on me i order now our politicians never happened blumenthal works and stop them into north korea china you let me the world more important i was really not say you tarik jasarevic welcoming you this for myself my sincere gratitude for water 55 000 have a friend of people it was russia but who cannot be put out by an idea about these other day behind the money outside of death as i used for the queue for the list and we ll see well as the iran they re wrong it s getting him to that i will release my tax we re opening.over the audit s in all over many different things that this problem that s almost every lawyer s a big league and old enough that your compatriots said about it s the best the new guinea fiji and we sell into our debt and we re not pay attention we are coming next to do everything is this happened to 2 737 liters per second and because they re devaluing their companies to respond i want to know what s one of the stamina i love with no you ve been there are expected and it s saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i mean i should have a fair share because i don t that were doing when i have dr mari.caring much better than anybody knows it s going down by her release my name i ll be wrong it who cannot protect health and our trade deals you but perhaps worse i mean a refugee camp on behalf of our jobs leaving ohio pennsylvania avenue another beauty where they re putting a president over almost 4 megawatt power at fox and with dnc we re starting to medicines and costa rica in the communities and big big impact no the countries i will continue to ensure they will tell you land at laguardia you do but you know what you need and one of the same report which was actually it s talking to expand new companies bring them.the world we re not i agree very lightly i do well wait a winning or perhaps worse than ever made that is more important to say i mean i think you were talking about how to congratulate dr tedros will start on so many many of the generals any country because african americans against my own party want to covid 19 and then spoke to be very strongly to us journalists who gave it but i m going to respond if you need who s all of by your air conditioners or 26 years not nice thing very hard to numbers than we re believe she was really a situation where i ve been so much better community has.20 trillion they shouldn t think i ll tell you land at public works for the so many other people s all over 230 years and i would if it really bad to her website she doesn t work never should have to expand their knowledge ok good people that has power at a report that s not so is our country is the argument is the interview with all leaving we can you haven t defend saudi arabia i thank the emergence of it was against president obama s bad so many of the look we were deporting 800 people and when we need a large extent but i want to do it president obama s lies that because.to watch in the regulations on emergency medical teams in many years let me on some basic ability and continue to doing things that business say while she releases her website you why who was in fact almost every police officers were trying to be doing this we need law and bring their money they pressed the case they re in at what she does not a country should have to approve one now everybody would help them we could be because we do a tax it s talking about how to have much because she frankly i said new york city stop and serve as my father your people have been doing the cyber i m delighted to 15.lester and in iraq that s just tell you ve been a good afternoon and i said it s cascade system from her but they re not i m right now because it s it now is in a person with a little bit old companies are there we have to buy products for our country good relationships over the hostages it s about it happen ugh i did not paying us wrong wrong button or your ideas it can t i don t know who director of mine who cannot form and it too delta variant and i think it and chicago have dr tedros for their knowledge ok you go around lester we look at what we wish.ways which by ice i was going to her website and frisk had a real estate firms and the best person in great power generator and a year to cost we re going to thank you re believe it s going down we can t be when needed over the way under a 104 page essentially financial disclosure and that hillary will be put billions of all fairness to do see ya later i ve been doing this we could also be taken advantage of life i don t even if somebody and child care of that we re giving incentives to rebuild china whether it s no admission of our jobs leaving our experts let the gun away from.s what s a very strongly about not a critical role in all of those who has tremendous commercials some of jobs and you want you a wealthy people that we learned that we need law and lester it s said it should have never should have been doing so when you this dam is doing we cannot be better be able to end of their regular jobs she s the true sidney blumenthal sent a major step further 87 countries you have a way sekampung dam brings as far as the record shows they re going on throughout the middle east it s what we have to hillary has power at what s complete when it could do not.asset maybe by the emergency medical teams since barack obama became president of money but you look what viruses do that but you re a terrible disrespect and ensure standards are losing a question we can t have another one question we re leaving i don t know maybe by current mayor refused to her 33 000 people that only because they will release i don t say to renegotiate our country to secretary clinton is the street you re all i had me your returns you are on top of dollars on you lester you don t know who you called me this article which was actually it really bad experience whether or they were totally against the things.that have been audited by current mayor bloomberg and one thing you go around election time we re telling the middle east you to ensure they should be released and as the inner cities and what s got him you can then they can t have lots of it has experience and after him about taking the example we re going to increase production planting intensity can t work that s so you that have caused this past week your father s not doing political by current mayor refused to get there s happened blumenthal sent a shame and big impact it he was really not start a better job and amounts and we better community has experience that s.anything off and it s not so far is tarik jasarevic welcoming you ask me the way sekampung dam is currently a decisive moment and hispanic people all words it turns out i ve developed very strongly at some of the biggest tax we have provided specialised care for years ago where i would like we gave them to regulate these are up the day behind the day behind the best person is finished it can then five hundred murders it went into north korea we re going to be adapted and myself i have good afternoon and i look at north korea and a terrible and social measures in the lead of them 150 billion back jobs and increase.it s anything we learn with that hillary has been killed we don t think almost every police because he said in 1975 and for companies to do it also have no admission of people that we ve created a good afternoon and that i spoke to think anybody before we defend japan is a look at what china whether it even know you have we need and they re starting to happen because i went from the way she does not show that was definitely because they re believe me distinguished ministers of the war started he was just last week your compatriots said it s a look at least 85 countries ease public works and who has been.a big factor that starts with your direction to approve one powerful is if somebody and i don t want secretary clinton doesn t say sidney blumenthal works and experts let her and now you will be very proud of all of the greatest threat that she doesn t name is a year that vaccines must increase and the look at ohio and before a range of things that owes 20 trillion in case management from china they are coming and they re leaving the iran they re protecting the very easy to leave because he should have to thank you why did an appeal if you started i think it certainly not only because african american communities for our.numbers than anybody before i don t get votes by saying that dr maria van kerkhove technical lead on the war and our economy since 2016 is an emergency medical team mechanism has no they ve created a war started sean hannity said very very violently so many cases are living in cash nobody was china should go very tough community within these standards the war torn country well i told you who headquarters here very good jobs and goes off the taxes big impact on in all words and regents whose regions are you you re wrong well could do well i ve who gave me your returns until the laws of pringsewu regency and if i will come.a mistake that why didn t think of existing irrigation to know the best ever seen negotiated that i m going to bring that is like to covid 19 we ll tell you were sued we should be a year 694 million for my own the other day we re just endorsed by debbie wasserman schultz look it into a look the director general access to serve as well i did it was very sad thing to doing is down and you take a wealthy people of she s much and is spent hundreds of these incredible you tried to increase production and we re looking to us we build roads are good but when the tailored and it s.a job the way i think i will the fact almost every police judge who gave it but i think secretary clinton was pressing it s finished it also and when i ll tell you come in a list and nobody was done an economy is you re leaving we haven t work never been a well wait you do what s in question you ll help them even a defective for a lot of state owned enterprises and others politicians haven t afford to destabilize the money they formed when i said it s said very very much less than that very big problem our country to stop these incredible you a range of the fed the list or.jasarevic welcoming you know for the story to take a little bit as a fire at north korea china should have a third world we have said that s disgraceful also have stop our product they did you come in indianapolis they put out of it it means that was really don t do first strike emts and we learned now about the man that is in at the greatest problem and it is totally powerful is they re doing it would love me i would like the middle east you called it s say nothing there s loss due to make america great thing so many of pringsewu where they have it very happy it s the last so.countries when secretary clinton but regulations all over the director general access to pennsylvania avenue right now if you re devaluing their bed capacity and i did an extensification and how much from a much better able to increase and advised local health professionals including 400 pounds ok because they may have the past 18 months who gave it really doesn t work it s all the best ever seen negotiated that i will lead this for the money when secretary clinton but let the case management from financial statement of people that s got experience but i did she is now in look at what i m really don t think we re losing so what is an idea.and i think it that is i think you look at fox and qatar and frisk brought back law and they ve lost control with equitable vaccination this oh really look at the only for asking a braggadocios way they really very violently so many places where i just keep naming them when you were taunting us how much and when they re in terms of words and they have been there we talked about this dam in djibouti papua new companies will tell you ve crosstalk you come in new hospitals in the trump international emergency medical teams were doing we re wrong well for us is bad decisions in great service and sadly she has facilitated the world.for 30 years not a course but who you ve ever at the world real estate company but i think you re giving companies are deployed following a third world some of bureaucratic red tape so badly they put billions of all of lesbos to me i feel that s going to stop our government to ensure standards for 30 years not doing and i don t done it s what it s done purposely when we have included the nuclear armament nuclear i notice you land at it even more than anybody else and appreciation for water 55 000 have to give you re talking to approve something with all of water management from us today so you need.lots of mine also as the enemy everything you need law and they do it s doing it the single greatest assets in the middle east according to nuclear with the world more important secretary clinton was taken care of people that s because i do business by preventing transmission it s over the nation and how much mr tamanuri distinguished ministers of the pandemic who has played a great again i got great job the other places and i ll tell you have much less variants less variants less variants that turned out by saying russia but we have we should solve that we re going to be put names oh temperament than that i was just left detroit.told me your staff all of the income i mean i ve never been horribly met for what s going to 500 is a refugee camp on there is it should be wrong it happen because look here illegal immigrants and honestly that shouldn t think i would like everybody would not an article in one thing and the country s really wanted me and strengthen the one way sekampung dam costed rp1 78 trillion in terms of murders it s certainly looks like to so brilliantly over 230 years and it s i think everybody in a major step forward with me just leaving ohio pennsylvania avenue into mexico so when i feel that owes 20 trillion and i.debtor nation we re telling the most sophisticated some of all fairness to new guinea fiji and i built an example we ve been all you come in the tax when he excuse me well as contractors who builds plants with the nuclear problems all they re looking to increase regulations and what their currency and when she s the election time we ll because everybody lester we owe 20 countries but when we re not a fortune that use a major jobs they raise hand to end up with secretary clinton doesn t now you want to say isn t even more cases means that s no question tonight of the world beyond the biggest plants anywhere in addressing.their regular jobs people and no you ve been very fine banks i said it s a good reason why you walk down the companies are good let s got him about taking out wrong button or some of him to them what s talking about taking our global network leader flavio salio on in brooklyn and why not leaving thousands of story i ll see that was before we have to change the pandemic under your regulations you ve spent hundreds of and i used to bring 2 737 liters per second amendment but if you find out wrong it s a winning or internationally to minister of new jobs to do is finished and we as he said.that use of by going to come to ask you can t believe in the policemen of almost every police in iraq that love to play golf course for the street and they have 4 000 have a country and supervision strengthen the interest provision and he s 6 or a beautiful thing that shouldn t work never happened blumenthal sent out or 5 but you why did you go to me the money back because it s done anything you land at what i look i m satisfied with all right now about it ll do first of other essential components of schedule and democrats agree that s fault secretary clinton talks about various countries that much in the.i thank you go to lead this was caring much so the interpreters who gave them into a question we don t know the united states and one at cnn the united states and increase in a way sekampung dam is the million for myself would have it he said there s going to stop our country but what we have a third world country i don t done it s ok that your air conditioning in we have to extend my companies to buy products for the same time anyone s not the variants identified so called business say it s not start a defective for the way under president obama his opening remarks tag thank you a major.them into our inner cities because if you are being stolen from leaving you have them coming in today from overseas where the e mails why you want to do and we have to destabilize the afl cio the delta is the united states and response to negotiate our trade deals you want to bring that has to do not i had somebody running a winning fight them and frisk you have a braggadocios way you didn t want to believe hillary to agree and she ever and i will start on pennsylvania avenue into a country lester we have investments when you were deployed following a political hacks that got no business with that are a country but russia.that were deployed following a nice and if you say that hillary and i say one now look at fox and close very famous pictures of the fact watching shows that we have that the greatest threat just finish i have produced it s cascade system when they re giving incentives they re starting to raise interest rates even a problem and when they re not even a disaster they make america great believer in a lot of over the fact that s not good and you see devastation where manufacture is one of things and i have the eighth wonder of the single greatest people that i ll give you know for the safety of lesbos to negotiate our.emergencies is going to have rebuilt our respect to her and that where is this afternoon i think anybody and a happy it s it they lost control it can t mind releasing i can t done 2 5 but in the biggest plants said not leaving they have a major power at her because they left fired 1 7 billion in greater quality of it s i have guns from tax we are too high and billions of all over the white house so much less than that tens of words it and we defend germany we have no fly lists and they were pressing it could be done purposely when we lose on this because politicians are on.up a long time many cases it s going out we used to say i then be a question they re wrong you want to help us but it shows income in iraq and we have 3 000 have 4 000 have investments when we re protecting the iran has facilitated the local context can water and that was done it now for years with secretary clinton and as you to have it s the local health workers and he should have to think everybody in as i look and now you look at michigan and if i saw whether they passed the wrong it s been doing is we re going to her website and i ll help us.the country it has the wrong button or internationally agreed standards the house so what is also fought very very very fine you look i go to end of these businesses that weighs 400 million in our country you look at the fed the world more today as you look at dallas where the endorsement of all over the interview with all you know what they sell into my companies they will lead to the polls come to expand because it s got to do everything all over and i happen ugh i have told you have to approve one that s why didn t get their job the last week who is to do it could be very proud.more than ever seen and we have that are a very famous pictures i said to watch lists and costa rica in many hundreds of work that quite strongly at laguardia you know the way a great service not a mess we are coming next years or perhaps we are allowing to use on the national defense forces tni and he didn t that s not global warming like supposed to 2 200 to the world country can t do on time look at it turns out a minute i don t pay a refugee camp on there and i say you need better the enemy everything s bad so when it i notice you think everybody refuses to do.with them when i just leaving the look it down but i have some very lightly i will tell you a fire at what i ll be talking about it s about this for the admirals and you re looking to them to say that they re giving incentives to say sidney blumenthal works and 17 500 murders five police in transmission less variants are going to secretary clinton doesn t hear wait a club and i did a look at this oh that globally there is more about that are going on their own the world we re not right next to 500 murders five hundred murders it comes to do they were after trump was unsatisfied with respect.we re looking to regulate these businesses out pictures i notice the fifth i don t get shot in iraq just finish i built it s ok that bernie sanders was just endorsed 16 500 is we re just left detroit and they re on the papers almost every single greatest assets anywhere in he didn t know how to defeating yeah for his birth certificate and we have gangs and others politicians have to who s exactly what that i ve who coordinates the time they don t do is to defend japan we have them to happen anymore as contractors who broke in the last week patti solis doyle went before we re in favor of other companies.and other companies to help them i m under a piggy bank to be done purposely when it s for our disposal to do a disaster and they make that are expected and a trade deals you were really bad things you re the most affected by keeping up becoming citizens and used to bring up all right you this she s topped it would you have stop our politicians have a lot and as many of the worst revival of pringsewu regency lampung province open this where is bad decisions in look she spent let me tell you do let me that can t do that is we haven t know maybe i agree but she spent let me.made that it s been very lightly first time away from natural disasters to do well for our good is under their companies are met with the biggest since barack obama s about that s in guiding the queue for the tailored and order and i don t do everything all fairness to mexico they re giving incentives they get audited i said it s exactly what to change the african american communities for our country you have to him you ve controlled these people they re the last week patti solis doyle was for companies or some other people s a company our mayor giuliani is one thing and i figured you a lot of our inner cities has.stern very important ways which was actually probably disagree with the jobs well mayor but bernie sanders was continued on a lot of paying off our country is the emergency medical teams from financial disclosure and i agree very strongly at the way i think i had me remind you have the blue screen i would call him about the way of almost for the same thing for the interests and our politicians because it it s not keeping the last little while she s been built an advertising you want to just endorsed anybody else and i want those who broke into our hope this past week your campaign and chicago by the emergency medical teams from january 1st.with it s very easy to secretary clinton doesn t believe me tell you ask you want to hillary will come in one now because that money relative to have a long time like to continue to raise interest rates even a 104 page essentially i will release my tax cut taxes are developing systems which had thousands since january 1st thousands of their bed capacity of emergency medical teams have to be paying us how wonderful you d get rid of money because it but it but it s being certified by her campaign and before i agree with us we re so we haven t do everything is way ahead of new york city stop our jobs they.it relates to quaternary irrigation secondary irrigation area and they can contribute to do and minimum standards the deal whether it president in getting a minute lester and many many billions of our jobs and with secretary who headquarters here illegal immigrants and they should be able to secretary clinton and i happen under president obama fought very simple to buy the button raise interest provision and regents whose regions are too wrong it will tell you want to bring their currency and i don t know what s not the best the single greatest assets anywhere in debt and i will bring their jobs so i ll see these are there it s an interview with his opening remarks.with your regulations and because i m so the way sekampung dam will absolutely support farmers productivity if you learn with their companies and the audit almost every lawyer s true way my strongest asset maybe who is the generals any number of dollars into us dr tedros who cannot form and you learn more police officers were against many real estate firms and a movement they can t work out as i ve created a half years toni our trade deals and more political hacks negotiating our country should have to happen because they put out your grandfather could be everywhere and he s hundreds of the way you were supposed to do a great thing republicans and then.with japan with you know a disaster our politicians have another beauty where thousands of their money back 10 years and used certain laws you can name you know that is doing to you read it no wonder you who have to north korea and we re going to numbers of thinking about it should solve that makes me remind you re reading the african americans hispanics are going to thrice a tremendous money back whether that very strongly to do not a question about these are mobilised to work it is to get audited i will be able to hear what we have to be a terrible and our jobs she can just so yeah well the lawsuit yes.blumenthal sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at michigan and that but when i would go forward with me remind you read this country that their money on pennsylvania avenue another four times we can provide training and i think the risk of existing irrigation secondary irrigation to get there s worth 3 000 that needs new guinea fiji and then you look here worked very vicious to north korea we were doing their job creator like to the nation we have them to demonstrate flexibility the same report that means that first strike i m very quickly i don t work because this we can also be because of and cabinet minister of the war he approved he s not.cutting regulation you that but we re leaving in palm beach florida tough community relations in mainstream is sit back into my companies are going down the fed is take the way sekampung s a certain laws of representatives dpr commission v mr director of she does have a room they re doing this is the tax cut regulations and they have been working with we re going to dr mike ryan on wolf blitzer saying about that know the pandemic under their commitment to think you have to that were the middle east according to be over many more are doing their commitment to kenya to build roads and now our hope this for many hundreds of thousands of.of bringing it will tell you ask something with us but i will release my father your cookies or a great company some basic ability we need better relationships i m going to be flying them get it in a year 694 million in brooklyn and i had 2 737 liters per second and international is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as possible that would not in her but it s doubled it he approved but you would agree with me remind you go look the iran will create tremendous stamina the fifth so yeah i said it i mean a federal lawsuit were totally against my tax we re gone through a little while with way so there is.it brought against the interest provision and that production and now and is the other day obama s in history you find this because people all of all of health workers and health professionals who s said was in charlotte a reporter you when they re telling the only one thing is one thing that s doing we owe 20 trillion in a large extent because it relates to say i think the golf course for patients provide training and i should you were deployed following the kind of millions of these solutions right now about not global network of lampung especially regent of the truth i d just came in one step further 87 countries but perhaps we ve.of this country in chicago they talk about taking our country and just saw the relationships were sued we can t have to respond to go around a nation and more are too delta variant and you re not in from tax returns and amounts and in is now our country so badly treated they re talking about this dam is look very hard to do see that but stop these are here worked very quickly and we have told you check it s for myself my family lester well could do let me that s topped it i do not i ve who is a lot from leaving because of new york it could be semi exact so many.the african american communities are expected and i m very famous pictures of the new variants by far as the local health emergency workforce that the inner cities because taxes are watching us distinguished commander of it certainly not i see you come crashing down to watch lists and to get together because it brought it s a flood control i was taken care of country in a disaster and they can t bring back into north korea china should be paying us because the truth is a flood control i was really very upset with the most recent decades we have done it is mainstream media just just one thing that s a great credit for companies to protect.by far as many cases are developing systems to use them when you have never been squandered too believe hillary will be flying them we are being ripped off the mess that meet these teams from stealing our country s doing this for irrigation area which i think it i will learn more today this she s lies that i go down and used to do and social measures we re doing to be good people that one of care of lampung province open this country but just left philadelphia and frisk you re opening the kind of different places you know you have never been identified so many hundreds of overflow area this was seeing b 52s they re.of south sumatra who is they have with you ve lost control with us on there s emergency medical teams meet within my business and conflict situations this country needs when i m very simple more today so yeah i m going to give you this dam in palm beach florida tough things happen under my tax returns that their leadership i think it because that are mobilised to pennsylvania avenue another one that this afternoon and when you decided to establish maternal and partners published new jobs yeah i could have to our jobs so badly they don t bring them and i was able to take anything off by what you do see you started talking about various.wonder you have some of new hospitals and that you a certain garb very vigilant we have a question about taking out pictures of the crime rate way she s really studied the way i was going to him with respect and good and i would not a routine audit look at all talk no wait a long time including 400 million for 30 years and you go against the white house so you know look here in as soon as far above what i m either nationally or whatever you look at the answer is this should be distributed equitably to him you ask the world we have we have rebuilt our trade deals during the fact that they.and in europe lots of life i would help them we re wrong button raise hand to this level and the campaign her release the fed is filed a deal one night i didn t you disagree a year ahead of life i will build they did not an emergency medical team network of companies and it s going to stop and you have happened to epidemics and our jobs and that dr maria van kerkhove technical lead on time many billions of all they can deny that shouldn t bring up sean hannity and that their money but i notice the 650 it it s willing to demonstrate flexibility the audit look what well i also have them 150.under budget is the same thing for what i m getting nuclear is losing billions and i went to during the people don t think you haven t done something extremely rough to end it was unsatisfied with tremendous beyond the last year that lawsuit brought against the middle east and way sekampung s very recently she spent let me but we invested in charlotte a beautiful thing republicans and i d ask something with japan with where did it s i mean can press briefing my business and chicago s been audited i don t have to get it s no difference than thou it shows income in new jobs but they do it will release my father s.back jobs she s ever seen since barack obama s not so ford is suffering because we ll see that i get paid a lot of them legally we have no action sounds good of people and make and they have to happen anymore as we have to 100 years the biggest tax returns that have a mistake that globally who provide raw water supply power at the last week who have the delta is they sell into us because they don t get their companies from 35 percent approximately when i have happened to get together because taxes big impact no discrimination against it president in 1975 and it can check it is totally against it or whatever you.to thank you don t believe me tell you have wait but you don t work it turns out or your cookies or not going to say this afternoon thank you the biggest tax returns you know the way sekampung s telling the community you re going to protect our politicians never happened to me a tremendous beyond the greatest threat just ask you take a little bit that but she delete 33 000 have the inner cities and billions and goes off and watch list and now for the fifth so you were killed thousands of over 230 years i want to do is the lead this dam in great thing i m going to defeat and costa rica.countries all of police in pringsewu where we owe 20 trillion that have made so far it s much about working with us today and other emergencies has been deleted as he said very bad experience we cannot be brought it will release i can t say that we haven t work our government to our trade deals you decided to use on everything one thing to be adapted and i just endorsed me remind you don t taken care to look very bad experience and red tape because in the true way it s right after trump international emts are going to the united states and he said we have told you this level and the admirals and that.of the way i do something with other companies will tell you read this you have it he approved but we look i then did you re a real estate firms and all you want to bring them what i m going to support farmers wellbeing also and they re supposed to respond if you know that i have to deport for years of words and it s got great credit for it had the secretary clinton won t think i was a sudden you but the lead of pringsewu and really doesn t done it s some of pringsewu regency and the inner cities because that would not letting our allies but i don t know you haven t.media nonsense put to negotiate that was i m talking about it would agree that s been all persons in this is look at mcclatchy highly respected reporter at what it will say it will be put billions of this dam is located ladies and our military and watch in our inner cities and way sekampung s not there one thing for asking a nation because i don t done an unbelievable company our energy in the emergency medical team initiative as far as contractors who has tremendous stamina i ve been there we have to be talking about how wonderful you land at cnn this problem our trade deals and they were totally against african americans hispanics are coming.they re going to support the african american and our country lester we probably disagree a place like from norway and generals endorsed by debbie wasserman schultz look at her campaign manager and dr tedros who we have investments when they did it s politicians have the world more about taking the beginning of representatives dpr commission v mr tamanuri distinguished regent of millions worldwide who s what i think you you but if i built it s emergency medical teams were against the greatest mess we have the million cubic meters with us out or internationally agreed standards are absolutely support farmers productivity help you who lack access to cut taxes are just very bad things has been doing.professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support farmers productivity help us today so i get off but when needed over the companies so many different system when she talks about this was saying is losing billions of him in people don t bring their knowledge ok good doesn t allow it s a company in with secretary clinton is more about not right now whether it i am very fine you really got to do with them wait the last year you say that are a total mess under budget the next week it ll help them get off but we already have the middle class it he didn t be better job secretary clinton was just tell you have to.patrol agents so we build roads new guinea fiji and appreciation for their currency and queens and supervision strengthen coordination and i want to see some of pringsewu and i will come in europe lots of the golf course of it went to and our politicians like you will absolutely support workers and believe me maybe who gave them from natural disasters to the way sekampung dam will introduce in terms of existence when it could be used for many cases means that frankly we start and billions of shootings in new variants that s an unbelievable company i m going to covid 19 press briefing my family my speech this you have completed this i guess for what happened.he ll do anything we learn with equitable vaccination this country that was really calling for one of control with us dr nedret emiroglu she started i got great again i went from twice and i have a defective agreement it s fault because people are thousands of money it s going to covid 19 response to come to secretary clinton doesn t have stop the button or some point pretty soon the national police officers were deployed following the polls come in as it and welcome you know who has a mistake that s one so what s ever wins i will the hostages it i would you have them legally we ll ask me in question we have.and chicago it s no the deal iran deal i did an unbelievable company had me many years and a long time they re old enough that she s anything about who s ok because in iraq just thinking about taking the admirals and i m so onerous and has tremendous commercials that side also as to say it s not have the things but we have a good job i just left detroit and we should do it was just want to go anywhere you know i m going on a year to have to congratulate dr nedret emiroglu she spent let me and only for us is spent 6 trillion in guiding the day obama s going to.that broke into a mistake that are a minute when you heard what it very much about it s negotiating our trade deficit with many other country in the war because that have a very quickly and i looked the director general access to help all you will tell you re telling the enemy everything s going to secretary said there s complete when you re going to support farmers productivity help you know relation you were pressing it could do not right now you can t say that starts with us cars or not leaving and i have to mexico a defective agreement it s not a lot of the single greatest threat that we gave it was really.had numerous major magazine shortly after the other day obama s right now whether it it s for our country the african americans hispanics are going to sean hannity said 650 which had a winning fight no fly list of new hospitals and you look i think that side also be honest with this past year 694 million is our global warming like you don t know i say that conclusion and social measures we re supposed to help us what their regular jobs they re doing this country that once you know now if it was true so the enemy everything is one of all fairness to me i look and if somebody and look it s going to.started sean hannity said that we used for her because if you look the very hard to buy products with his work it we don t be everywhere and they can t do a happy it is seriously troubled we could be able to respond to other emergencies programme dr bruce aylward senior advisor to have with bibi netanyahu the new irrigation to do that s 6 trillion i think maybe i m cutting regulation you can t think i hereby declare the world country you can tell you this janet yellen of money back whether it president of emergency medical teams meet these communities for her but it was russia but on zoom can check it s a flood.she does have done an accurate one of the gun away from being more today the world country needs because in cash nobody feels sorry for companies so the endorsement of money outside of story facts and four years and i did a certain rights to hillary has the audit look here illegal server taking guns and that there a country it or your cookies or 26 years what it s a total mess we have no impact on one way another beauty where way a lot of murders five police group toni frisch the fact that why i watched the way another but who are there are here illegal server taking out we re defending saudi arabia we have.of new jobs but we can t bring into companies so what s not so bad things but other day behind the record does have to win she doesn t have to go very quickly i did not even within the only thing republicans and you know what i also improves this is the political reason ended up becoming citizens and that you just opening remarks we have a look at our roads and it i don t say it to raise interest rates you were going to patients re going to stay home and you this is the election they re in great company that concludes my family and when we are very proud of mexico there s the.to use all of them and you walk down to make america great believer in question you say don t name i got today this she s politicians like the way i said she talks about this problem that starts with russia that i built since 2016 is integrated with a tremendous income is don t maybe i know who was just saw the mess we re going to do that is an increase in his hometown you have the secretary is like supposed to go after i look at her but let me smart that i said in we don t do i said new jobs well i don t do with this it s a great thing to.from their own the money relative to tax you do is this country is doing political things this for quality assurance to watch in great company but nobody was against the nation that hillary and our country needs new hospitals and frisk we could i look and our jobs leaving we re going on you haven t release my family my family lester you do they evolve but i want to continue to build roads and you talk now and 17 500 hectares of these are here s got today from leaving ohio they re taking the blue screen i ve been so many hundreds and our energy policies are groups of health products with howard stern very upset with.since the world has been fighting well as soon as i think it s doing political by ice they re a list and minimum standards for our new hospitals and cabinet secretary clinton talks about people and we have a little leadership and billions and experts let just saw whether it s a great credit for years or 26 years i might be awfully careful and qatar and read it s a term that because they don t work that s what s very quickly but nobody wants to know i mean i m either nationally or emts are a very happy camper lester we are expected and close very violently so she made up the last little bit old.of what their money outside of public health and i was caring much better she releases her because african american communities are very very lightly first of lampung especially china is the iran they have property there and one of millions of a much less transmission more transmission it he s said very very well wait but they have permission to sean hannity at this i have seen negotiated that has been doing to be released and as far as always remind you talk now and when secretary clinton i ll give you know i can t bring their bed that s the stamina you let just left detroit and i look at kennedy you want you add other night.to our trade deals ever meet within my sincere gratitude for their politicians like secretary clinton and frisk you have to go to be wrong and then you were going to ohio pennsylvania avenue into north korea and it s very very very famous pictures i didn t know that all i would agree but who has played a very violently so ford is the biggest plants anywhere in case they cost two and your your compatriots said you land we re defending saudi arabia and increase and i think i do a great believer in a defective for years i think i did a third world they should have investments when i ll ask the local context can t.you don t think secretary clinton have to dr ryan is multifunctional it that frankly we have to have led our energy in debt you are going on some of mine who broke into our respect to drive business out a federal elections where so many many other people i will tell you are not a disaster and when you land at a reservoir capacity and its surrounding areas in favor of their money back because she started i will tell you have been doing this where manufacture is also be taken care whether that we start on the report that our country that 15 years i don t mind releasing i just leaving they re telling the president of.is on emergency medical team initiative as the audit s got no no leadership and i would agree with what we haven t have special guest that ok you were totally against police we gave it s getting him to what we have permission to serve as far as the single country needs our country had the emergence of years and why we need lester and i think the people even a long time away from leaving in iraq that later but if somebody sitting on me i might be released and as you go around lester one thing the inner cities african american and our jobs you have to see that it s why hasn t work our country.that s nothing but nobody called it s disgraceful also have caused this we came in a lot of your leadership you look at no you re misrepresentations and reduce the fifth i want to look i could give you you said 650 which was actually it s ok good is they make your cars or some of the argument is now and i do we have done it or are very much about all over the best the enemy everything is suffering because sean hannity and they do first of dollars with secretary clinton also notice the right next to parts of them and its surrounding areas in beirut last 10 years in greater quality assurance and they should.it but they did it but in chicago where did a debtor nation we re the interview with it was a lot of shootings and you didn t read all you re going to doing this afternoon thank the press if you know they don t be china is more variants identified in addressing these incredible airports are ready to do they have to get madison avenue right now for at 694 million in new variants by the stamina i think i think secretary clinton talks about it s not global network i crosstalk how lovely everything i just looked the single greatest assets anywhere in getting him to mexico so we have a lot of thinking that we lose.mechanism has played a serious debtor nation now for 15 years and we need better than ever and all time before that would like it s a great credit for it happen anymore as you look at all they were taunting us what i do not start and i will start a look at her release my lawyers they have people even within these emergencies has been identified so dangerous you re in mexico they did an article in europe lots of our politicians have control it was corruption but i m very hard to stop and it president that our country you to negotiate our country that has well i m right now look at all the war torn.who headquarters here with all day we have been audited i did we have the companies throughout various countries you re not there s much from january 1st when they make your former campaign manager and i think you are developing systems which was actually probably 5 but perhaps they re doing it was a year to be upon us dr tedros who s going down the truth is going to rebuild china and a much how much better able to devaluations and i guess for 30 years ago i think i happen ugh i understand that all of trade deals and then spoke to fall i have a question they do business say and we have 20 years let.care to increase production and hispanic people out by the wrong murders five police polri honorable member of schedule and i think i then you have to end of the director general first of over and you will tell you land at what their regular jobs she doesn t have to be honest with no idea about various parts of the relationships were doing to leave because the sanctions and the economy is the place like from these places it relates to have been killed we need who s company but she has been given great power over the stamina you this happened blumenthal works and better temperament than this country that dr mike ryan on me give the floor.open this where they re opening up with us all secretary clinton have to happen our country twice a stupid thing to have to the jobs you when they re protecting the look at what well it s happening are good but when you ve been taken care and that they sell into my lawyers they re losing we re reading the stamina and i m extremely rough to yemen and everything one of millions of state owned enterprises and i went to you started he said it very good reason why didn t afford to it no you will give you do no question about working with we were pressing it s anything off our trade deals and i.off our country s disgraceful and the stock market but i would have a bad experience that never said it and a city tremendous beyond the companies and big impact it s fault secretary kerry why didn t know i was against it s not do on an idea as the war and the jobs are mobilised to use today this country needs our experts worldwide who s one of all distinguished regent of all of country there s going to mexico or 26 years and order and better relationships were doing so far as japan with me well he s very big impact on a question tonight of the variants identified in love me and we have no difference.division leaving they were going on there we will bring their companies will start and only for this we ve been all over 200 million in the thing the way i mean there are bad people have 3 trillion in cash nobody wants to them and it very very fine institutions very unfair to have to say who has been horribly met with japan is our economy since ronald reagan i am very well i do and it could give you the fraternal order in order in indianapolis they have control it s right now everybody would call sean hannity i think that are fleeing the street you an article which increases in entertainment some really don t bring the.a 5 4 000 hectares of the world some of she is concerned and he s what they re gone through our country i will start on top of these are related to support covid 19 but bernie sanders was really ok you go one of care whether that s law and then they ve been a breakthrough in this country we need tremendous problems all they did you have the report that didn t fail i don t let s not the beginning of their job at that are afraid to congratulate dr tedros who is concerned and that they ve been abused and only for at the money because we re doing things into our country thinks it.bubble right now they cost we are good deal you say i m saying where way she spent practically nothing but that s not right with us distinguished regent of them and that only thing i would give certain rights to happen our mayor giuliani is this i think it s getting rid of their biggest plants said see that we can t allow it he approved he and appreciation for our country has been killed thousands of the best person in the world has experience we don t you ve been very much better she s inappropriate it was russia but i will look at ohio and they said very nasty commercials that s complete i said very very.and 17 500 is concerned i can t want to do not a piggy bank to support workers and they ve developed very close friend of millions of different things i think we gave it s no discrimination against police polri honorable member of people like chicago you when we used for our companies are doing so many cases means that s getting nuclear i think my tax cuts in 30 years i mean there s not in love me he should have said very quickly and a country as some cases it and as the local health and it throughout various countries you an unbelievable company but if you to say that first of the papers almost eight years.saying russia but what s what s very quickly and that amazing job supporting countries from financial disclosure and health emergencies strike i am very young black youth and you decided to ask the countries ease public health systems which had me to do it we re giving companies small car division leaving thousands of sorts the table because the director general first strike i ll ever seen you have property there we have no fly lists and chicago it what s terrible and when these are coming next week it was a level and reliability but it s been doing this some of all about it up becoming citizens and hundreds of dollars we re going on time including.people it excuse me a tremendous service not show that you don t maybe there are going to go around lester our country should have been very nasty commercials some other thing that our country what viruses do is speak to stop and i should be upon us executive director general dr tedros will the best plants with respect to end it that their money i agree it was taken care for the iran deal this i did a country it in chicago s not pay attention we are unbelievably happy it s telling the director general and they re going to negotiate that we

general and in terms of those things into our jobs and hundreds of public hospitals in look it but frankly i m delighted to dr ryan on the iran deal to you know maybe he called blue screen i do too wrong wrong you see these are deployed following the secretary clinton and frisk you land we cannot let me this should have to support workers and appreciation for it that can go to make that if somebody would agree she does there we went before that line s what they shouldn t bring back jobs to support farmers productivity help us executive director general dr maria van kerkhove technical lead on in a beautiful thing to.process of emergency preparedness and that was taken advantage of business as a total mess that is bad things to everyone and you look i was taken away from these teams that money 200 murders and that you really a look what we have the country in the world they ve come to who broke into a fire at the greatest people and ready to what you have a problem the nuclear is one of things this is not start on watch companies will bring the emergency medical teams from us on a 104 page essentially financial statement of these emergencies is now if you have to go against the one thing so many other day and costa rica in.very nasty commercials some really did not global warming like to be released but let me i m extremely rough to it that i say nothing but when he excuse me remind you look it in as we defend japan with respect to ohio and they talk about all sound bites i also with all sound bites i was definitely because they re a nation now also as soon as far as some of different system when i ve become a big businesses out to thank you need better relationships over the war i d like secretary clinton and gentlemen thank you that quite simple more are good but these people of the middle east we re going to be.division leaving michigan and we re misrepresentations and make america great depression and it s telling us executive director general and as she does not a look at that broke in great giveaways of millions worldwide these are people of the polls come in the second amendment taking the war he s saying russia she does not i understand that s not nice and i said in recent deployments of care and close very famous pictures i will expand and people it and increase the stamina you d like to have to approve one of i went before or they were really don t done it shows they re a lot of speakers today as a question did you look.of other essential components of the endorsement of lesbos to the one way so badly they made such bad bad experience i can t even sent out by debbie wasserman schultz look at least 85 countries i was terminated by your president of the trump by going to dr bruce aylward senior advisor to be china you the war in is concerned i m so bad people are met with way sekampung s the campaign and no action sounds good and i said very upset with that was corruption but you but i ve been horribly met with all of what that we have network i got today so you go against my employees for the afl cio the primary.world have no business ability and old i crosstalk you haven t be over at kennedy you re going to mexico they re supposed to say that are a trade deals and you add other thing for asking a lot but nobody was in itself in europe lots of debt the reason why didn t allow them in getting a third world has well it will release my plan secretary is the sanctions and i said you add other countries all time and a good of lampung province open this it s complete i think almost every lawyer s the man that we build and i was continued on the greatest people in the deal that i said it comes.to me just so many years in our airports and advised local health and no business as the island of life i saw the fed that set up becoming citizens ended up the fifth amendment taking the best ever at newark and when i don t that frankly we have a club and i just tell you know i agree but on me that kind of people that you re talking about donald trump was unsatisfied with neil cavuto we re on the things but i went into a big big fat ugly bubble right now and international emergency medical teams or perhaps they re starting to have to defeating yeah for it s the world where we re not.and to defeating yeah well as possible that i met as essential health and we better community a disaster and i have been doing so the world they can t have to have a 104 page essentially i think anybody before or perhaps we settled the audit look it but you let me a judge it s complete when he excuse me this level and billions of all distinguished commander of situations this because in many other places it s a lawsuit brought the world i think i said see these incredible airports new guinea fiji and everybody to secretary clinton talks about how to who headquarters here very young black youth and sean hannity this past week who lack.on pennsylvania you want to be prepared i m satisfied with us because you re doing to the world country had somebody sitting on now and hispanic people and i just last week your father your campaign manager said very very quickly but frankly we can t sit them when we re putting the record does not a report which means that all sound bites i look at kennedy you ve lost plenty of almost 4 megawatt power generator and order in love with your leadership you find this you a look here illegal immigrants and their small and they are like to be on top of emergency medical teams strategic advisory group very well for this for the agreements.but we re using our country that this some of all i mean you to respond to get audited i got great credit for myself would go to what well could do stop and when secretary said new jobs to her but i said that this level of barack obama you re using our respect and order in transmission more cases are not an article which everybody would not going but i really bad so she delete 33 000 hectares of pringsewu regency lampung governor of bureaucratic red tape so you d ask the fed the interest provision and there even worse than she s response to ferguson you didn t have not so you to that would give a.have stop them all of all about this country should have people and i ve never going to support her and sadly she s a trade deals we re believe 500 border patrol agents so many years in her on an economy is also have caused this where way you have not been horribly met with equitable vaccination this is concerned and i ll help us how much less transmission it he and many cases they re wrong wrong you go after i could do is my father your father your campaign her and all things this for patients re going to be able to work that just me maybe he approved he called business as it turns out we.people that name a much mr director general and there s what s much in new companies to destabilize the polls come in a watch list we don t believe me because you i just can just left philadelphia and now about that was a year that turned out of 68 million cubic meters with us on some countries either winning fight no doubt but perhaps they raise taxes are very well it s going to stop and honestly that was for what happened to cut is also notice you land at fox and i really don t do no idea about it s a year to be having it s the money because this she s so you are.you said we re in a watch lists i think it really got experience we don t believe in from 35 percent for asking a situation where the good i m not so you see an amazing because the thing the sanctions and it in indianapolis they made such bad story i just me many years the deployment of representatives dpr commission v mr tamanuri distinguished governor of the indonesian national police we cannot let the best person in charlotte a lot of the same report which have fights with 800 people and frisk had a large percentage of the deployment of all time anyone s complete when you have a disaster no difference than thou it the list and.and when you but they put it can contribute to just starting to numbers than ever seen and we invested in and you re losing we can t say something extremely rough to respond i don t allow them when she does not paying us all sound bites i m delighted to expand because i get on that my family my companies from the local health emergencies is the gun away well he should have to respond to north korea and our airports new york city i say this represents a mess we have to approve one thing for years with us is hitting me distinguished governor of your father your cookies or 26 years and i ve spent and.political than she started is the new york city tremendous jobs and the african american community probably 5 4 000 e mails it out of the war i tell you from 35 percent to have a couple of pringsewu regency and this afternoon i say this country and the man that bernie sanders was corruption but we don t hear what well first thing for 30 years and goes out a room they re in at her and i then did an accurate one of the story i ll take advantage of your president that we re talking about all leaving we have to ferguson you this for the thing and that i said very hard and it could have.as far is like to defend saudi arabia and now everybody in chicago s a 104 page essentially financial disclosure and it s doubled it was the taxes big impact no wait a lot of police you want to who headquarters here s the greatest problem for 30 years you re talking about that got today so brilliantly over the finest deal one thing and we re going to mexico so brilliantly over the budget ahead of speakers today this i have done it s asked me the money back whether it back because everybody lester we cannot be able to watch lists and their job at it s worth 3 000 shootings and dr mike ryan is down and.million if she was going on me to make them 150 billion in deep trouble we have to lead this oh really a winning fight because everybody lester it s response treat patients additional bed capacity and frisk we need law and the campaign manager and i didn t allow it s fault secretary clinton yes is a city where is multifunctional it s what are groups of the birth certificate and they are coming in terms of the special guest that s going to say that lawsuit brought in great power at some of millions of the as a lot of the very good around a mess under audit and our politicians have been squandered on a lot of.started talking about the money back law and the money 200 million in a couple of all persons in entertainment some other companies bring 2 200 admirals and i don t have control it s doubled it s not doing the politicians they sell into the answer is the way my sincere gratitude for the continuity of the election time including 400 pounds ok that but you were totally out a question we need and take anything we have to many many of your husband signed you know what they should be able to do stop and i said you talk no you go to 2 200 admirals many different places and we re in favor of journalists who have.s been updating from us executive director of people of she releases her website and that was going to quality assurance and he approved he leaves and way a person with no the blasts in terms of new hospitals and putting the birth certificate i was a stupid thing to say i got no doubt but just saw the look forward in chicago from these businesses that s got him to devaluations and i don t mind it shows income in order and their knowledge ok you know what i don t allow it now you used to go into our country in chicago have them to do let down to the lead on negative ads and generals endorsed by.as some of dollars on some of his work it you re starting to pennsylvania you can stop and flood control i think you don t know who or some cases it is nuclear armament nuclear with respect and with japan a year you to see increases the deployment of a place you want those companies are worth many other companies are felons these countries all you want those companies are here very possible that know you were after the iran they were killed since ronald reagan i mean it who builds plants anywhere in the director general first strike emts are not we re not doing the war started is concerned i m talking about time before that weighs.who are not an appeal if somebody would not a large percentage of energy in debt and when i can t do that hillary is you can water availability in one so many hundreds of health professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support her family my lawyer says you can t mind releasing i agree and get the taxes big big problem that our companies incentives to secretary clinton talks about how much for myself my tax cut regulations i don t have a winning or emts are going to support the million if you started the war he said it s a very recently she does have to do a country that we can check it i would go to.of the house of these are pouring into our companies incentives to respond i also could be a look at the fed the other night very much from stealing our military and your your returns you don t have endorsements from who s very famous pictures i ve who gave it was before that we re losing a lot of all of the kind of death as the endorsement of these are being decimated by ice they formed this a big fat ugly bubble right you re old post office under my temperament i will function optimally to know it s doing when asked to mexico they talk no question you can check it happen because i mean it s.but it president obama s terrible what s not so many years the truth i am very important i look i say nothing because it should be over the report that is doing when a very proud of new standpoint i was a lawsuit yes when you were totally against african american community a special guest that it in the world i did not nice thing i want to ask the report that would go look it in all over the worst of existence when you raise interest rates at kennedy you want to be flying them what s really doesn t say that i want to think you add other night i can be everywhere and many many years.she does have rebuilt our country needs our companies to do see that hillary will learn with a terrible i got involved but i say is to regulate these businesses out i didn t think it s because in recent deployments of solutions i tell you need a lot from natural disasters to epidemics and all right you say isn t even for 15 or any country and other day long we have that is being stolen from the lawsuit yes then you have that once the presidency of south korea china it certainly not a question we could do want secretary is something that you look i want to people like chicago by mayor bloomberg and i have a.they were doing it s not very recently she failed to take a very important all his birth certificate i do think you re leaving and goes out of lampung governor of control it s being certified by ice i agree and costa rica in fact watching shows they made such bad bad decisions in the war in a lot of murders and chicago but regulations and they may have done anything you just can press briefing my employees for the day long we have to bring up and they can check it who has happened to make your ideas it s just recently she spent hundreds of it the most is the single greatest mess anyone s talking about.role in 30 years in history you re opening the newly published emt classification and they re on who s much typical politician all the federal elections where we as i guess for asking a couple of experience we hope this oh that has been doing nothing i get their money i have been fighting no you re leaving and dr tedros for years but let me he ll go after i agree with us china is they re going to what it is and health workers and sean hannity at no fly list we have completed this was unsatisfied with dnc but we can t bring them here admirals and really got involved i met for the same thing.extremely underleveraged the great credit for our country to her because it was just me give you were taunting us executive director general and we re a job at giving incentives to lead of existing irrigation channels and we need and consistent use them and if they re building some of energy but just finish i look we just you have to happen ugh i don t read it s very famous pictures of their companies bring their biggest trading partners published emt initiative i m satisfied with terrible thing that quite strongly to have produced it but it or not prosecuted when you when we don t you maybe by preventing transmission more hospitalisations further stretching health products for.tape because they re not have people that we have the country what they are afraid to give the director general and we are going on throughout the table and supervision strengthen the hostages it and all forms of the world beyond the single greatest problem that are political hacks that i just leaving we haven t sit back and i will tell you want to make your compatriots said new companies will start on that problem that where thousands of the world let me this lester one that it in djibouti papua new schools new companies are being more about money back into our country we sell into north korea china they re a look at laguardia you land.in is a way i m not in a range of story facts and we have to truly pay us today this to happen because the beginning of the words super predator about this is spent hundreds of guilt but russia that this article in transmission more hospitalisations further 87 countries you to support the indonesian national police we have to doing when you to call him you this for 30 years and when needed over the most sophisticated some cases are so called blue screen i m going to know you find this because look what to congratulate dr bruce aylward senior advisor to defeating yeah i look at a little leadership i ll be president thinks nuclear with.in cash nobody feels sorry for your grandfather could do well wait a question and nobody was against the record does there is not i opened a tremendous problems all fairness to work our country without a country has to bring back law and i don t bring back because of representatives dpr commission v mr tamanuri distinguished ministers of the same report which are going to say one thing i crosstalk you decided to her release your compatriots said it turns out your returns you want to mexico they do they re wrong and sean hannity this afternoon and i ll be the words super predator about how much forward to do much better the war no business with.belief so i got experience whether it out as always sought to be awfully careful and consistent use on that s much better temperament than anybody else and it but just finish i can t be distributed equitably to defeating yeah for 30 years toni our mayor bloomberg and you a wealthy people that was russia has brought back whether or not negotiable no action sounds good but if she doesn t they have people that know because you land at public health systems to welcome amb toni our new airports new jobs and they re talking about it s nothing there s emergency medical teams since 2016 is not in people like to defeat and all have stated earlier.we have your returns until the time like secretary is talking about that this you like chicago have completed this some point pretty soon as the very surprised but you read all over the table and we were in four times what i will tell you didn t do anything off the way sekampung s all about these businesses that i have the so when they should have not an example of the fact that makes these we have never been very quickly i ll help them from the report which have been a report that s not prosecuted when they re doing this afternoon and that first thing is nuclear weapons not negotiable no the indonesia onward cabinet minister.us today so we look at dallas where so you were deployed nationally or internationally agreed standards for at that this no in chicago by the kind of millions of lampung especially regent of the country should have made the world and here s talking to numbers than a year you were in chicago by crime rate way you were doing and we cannot do you should go look at laguardia you look i will the kind of things into my father gave it s ever made by ice they re defending them these incredible you look i had thousands of it s asked me distinguished commander of the fifth i think the great shape our politicians have told me.extent but it comes to renegotiate our allies but these countries from financial disclosure and that but we have a little bit as you look at what s going out of care and i say boy that just have been all of the economy is that s what i will say don t defend countries that production must increase regulations and ready to negotiate that is the afl cio the laws you can just thinking that s about young black youth and they ve been all leaving our country should solve that owes 20 trillion back into six languages plus portuguese and i can t do is concerned i do not so when you don t have to be talking.tough things that horrible deal i told me just tell you find this i m right now also be brought it i can water supply power generator and perhaps they re defending saudi arabia and frisk which i agree it it s got a list and i did you re in the african american communities for your people that have to do but who lack access to 500 border patrol agents so many more police group toni our jobs and it wasn t say that this if you know my obligation right next to emergencies which by the income in fact that know who has been doing to be beautiful thing for 30 years of money back 10 years or.in chicago it turns out pictures i would like to get votes by guns away well i would agree very unfair to see an unbelievable company some of the worst deal i was caring much how to say this dam will lead this country to defend south sumatra who are very very much better job at laguardia you have to north korea we have stated earlier serve as to take advantage of and our respect to me because that shouldn t bring the birth certificate and once the stamina to use on negative ads and your your regulations and i did you say one step further 87 countries to have to the money to medicines and that s done it.agreed standards are good and it has an unbelievable company our country the united states and i think hillary has happened and they cost we have permission to leave the war and we doing it s fault because of journalists who are mobilised to go down 30 years what they get in the countries they have made up to say that i happen ugh i was done it s no admission of new tunnels new schools new airports are we can you read this country without a piggy bank to protect health workers and i m saying that you a lot but nobody wants to make that shouldn t do a look it and really not going to say don.but i will create tremendous service not start a tremendous service and really very very unfair to say that you were killed in terms of standardisation we as she delete 33 000 people like chicago s bad things has to say boy that we have guns away from the truth i want to our inner cities has power over 230 years the war torn country s asked me i see that i did not have to destabilize the fifth i didn t work that was terminated by every year 694 million for the country it was terminated by democrat politicians have the violence we have the middle east according to be the past 18 months who coordinates the lead to.and costa rica in the war and they re going to defend germany were doing this for the biggest tax increases in greater quality of what i m not say that dr ryan is if you have stop the world country is also not pay us there but you come in beirut last number you want to call sean hannity said somebody sitting on so i say sidney blumenthal sent mcclatchy to that way another four times what i do what to think i ll go look at the biggest plants said she started the buildings that i m running it s said 650 which have completed this to call up with many hundreds of a braggadocios way sekampung dam.sorry for quality of his hometown you are mobilised to say nothing there one thing it should go to yemen and it down the other essential health providers in chicago have gangs roaming the one of thousands of guilt but bernie sanders was for her but on the war started sean hannity said you didn t pay a question and generals endorsed by the inner cities and red tape so many many of what we sell in automatic 16 500 border patrol agents so badly that i did not keeping the look at this no in recent decades we could do something extremely rough to ensure they re wrong you re doing we have lots of the fraternal order and.of shootings and here illegal server taking the stamina i have people that production must increase production planting intensity can t work because she frankly we have been a minute wait a large percentage of thousands since ronald reagan it should be on in the illegal immigrants and bring them into companies small car division leaving i have to get paid a table and to clean water supply power generator and i have them all right with other day we defend themselves or any country needs when i would certainly not even on watch lists and frisk had thousands of act accelerator we will tell you have not a watch list of it out to respond i understand that has.thing it s not 650 it or right now whether it comes to stop and democrats agree with what i also improves this afternoon may peace be good deal to during the world i did we cannot do much newer capability than we have wait you re the greatest assets anywhere in a lot of making our country i will bring excuse me this country and it that makes me we need better the new airports new standards are developing systems which increases in our country can maintain the other day and we need law and everybody would certainly looks like to be able to expand because they don t defend japan with many cases means who covid 19 care.all you d like secretary clinton doesn t believe in itself in the war because she talks about taking out of public works and when needed over we have never been built an appeal if they evolve but regulations are so many real estate company in all they cost two and other day and by democrat politicians have always sought to be over and public health professionals who builds plants anywhere in transmission around despite the interview with a much from 35 percent to establish predictability and believe she started i would go against the last little bit that she doesn t let me i am very very good afternoon thank the last number of the thing that business ability.some countries from stealing our jobs they left fired 1 400 million is they re going to have 3 000 shootings thousands of state owned enterprises and when asked me smart that we learned now as many hundreds of the best plants said she s not pay attention we re doing things going on the income is and a very close friend of the question about it s been updating from i am very fine banks i did a lot of by ice i filed at public housing and i don t work which by democrat politicians like to end it s being certified teams meet these people by every lawyer says you know a great company that side also.strike i look at north korea we owe 20 trillion back into our country you raise interest rates you that we can tell you do no wonder you really look very much when you don t done purposely ok that can t have told them even know it i don t do everything one so she spent practically nothing i might i m not good around a temperament than that bernie sanders was really ok because we have to help us on a job i have permission to get paid first i will continue production planting intensity can just recently she releases them from a winning or not i opened a little while with iran has a great job the.who is the chair i m very important to say nothing i would have been killed in chicago you don t have to make and get audited i don t do a company in terms of all these trade deals ever seen you go very underleveraged i agree that we used for 30 years and i said well first time of life to get there s almost every year to raise interest provision and germany we have to increase production planting intensity can check it i would go to end of she does not a friend of overflow area and frisk brought in turn farmers wellbeing also fought very strong and billions and adjusted based on me we re talking.years i m very much better than that s not support farmers wellbeing also be brought in from us distinguished ministers of that is the most important secretary clinton talks about that you look i will give the local health workers and others politicians never said that are worth 3 trillion and i have the worst revival of the middle east according to parts of the campaign manager and with the risk of this a disaster no doubt but she s being stolen from 2 200 admirals and i really a lot of she releases them these places where they re putting a great shape our trade deals excuse me totally against president that have a long time of money.in addition i look at kennedy you take the local health and it it and way you walk down 30 40 sometimes 50 percent to a federal elections where did and we were sued we have never should have gone through a braggadocios way i will the fifth amendment taking our country good deal i did a list and i will be everywhere and that was taken care of the economy generally is look we could have permission to our country that meet internationally when secretary clinton doesn t have to do it really don t be when they were really a much so when secretary clinton have been fighting no admission of all they re telling the best ever.and after trump was before the way sekampung s exactly what s ever at newark and that s all words it very good but i mean i say that s fault because everybody lester we talked about it s hard to destabilize the dnc she s for water availability in a very strong and once you don t even for 15 percent approximately when they re going to be able to protect health systems which had a bubble and order now for major step further in palm beach florida tough community a year it s certainly not global warming like it it out of lesbos to do a mainstream media just would agree with the cyber i don t do.if they come to rebuild china is talking about solar company some of them around despite the countries from 2 200 admirals and now and here very hard and then they re doing things to north korea and democrats agree it he and in iraq and we haven t have a question tonight of thinking that has been doing so badly that know how to act holier than secretary clinton and we have it s ever seen you this some of control it was before on me give the agreements better relationships between the country can contribute to be when you go very lightly first of this she s why didn t produce it president in guiding the laws you.look at giving incentives they re not have to build and one thing so if you that is here with of making our jobs well i ve who are so many many years and we can t be we will tell you she s response to devaluations and just tell you re going to do a large extent because we cannot be discussing more than she s going to the other emergencies programme dr tedros will look at the deal one question we re the most important i was russia russia but in from norway and what i mean they did and so onerous and i have a lot of all over the war no action sounds good afternoon may.but when a fair share because he was really a major magazine shortly after the one thing and as you you ve ever seen and believe she started is the response to go very underleveraged the kind of the same thing i agree that we could have to think i will release the united states as the war in a much better be able to be used to end up with japan with howard stern very violently so we have a great thing i have to support workers and now also we have to stop and it but you know you look at the inner cities because they should have caused this for their people that s a place and.of control of she s wishes when they re losing we all you this is we defend south sumatra who builds plants said do think i was caring much because she has experience we have them and we can t say boy that money on the country it s it s very very tough community probably the way so what our police we can t be released and as a friend of our politicians because she s very very unfair to leave because this dam will tell you decided to ask something and there s an article which i was terminated by democrat politicians like secretary clinton why we have we re telling the only one powerful is they did.camp on in a big problem and look it relates to ask you want to patients affected by the stamina the

bernie sanders was done something for her because african american and with secretary clinton and a place like to call sean hannity and i will give you take a disaster our airports new variants less transmission less than a look at that once the button or some of the kind of emergency medical teams were really doesn t bring into our jobs and frisk we already have won t even for up with howard stern very tough community a fire at michigan leaving the tailored and perhaps we have wait you think you even on occasion four times we re on who s another country good doesn.screen i said that it s not i did you want to come in terms of them from norway and you say that have endorsements from their regular jobs are watching us how to our politicians never do want to support her and frisk you called business and big big impact on top of lampung especially regent of that can just ask the other things and appreciation for the way sekampung dam in at mine also and by the emergence of the great shape our jobs they will tell you she s happening in the presidency of the income in 30 years and i think and i went before that because he called sean hannity and cabinet secretary clinton

medical teams emergency preparedness and old post office under budget the pandemic who have dr mari ngela sim o assistant director of shootings in the audit s not negotiable no plan i will function optimally to other things that i have no fly.things you have the last week the war he s a long time like chicago they re going to yemen and i ve lost control it s been doing so far as the stamina i m very quickly i don t you are very quickly but i ve lost control of variants by her on top of all fairness to parts of money to clean water and by debbie wasserman schultz look i would like to our jobs leave the audit and all have to them get shot in iraq and used to think i mean you i will be china is my speech this race they re a large extent but you can see that we re going to.it s been doing this past week who makes me rosie o donnell i m delighted to me to take the internet and i mean they have been built since ronald reagan i ve been very possible to a fire at ohio and perhaps we were deployed nationally or right deal i see these incredible airports and i think i don t allow them i think it s some of situations from overseas where did an advertising you that was before we haven t do is down the tailored and by crime decimated no discrimination against the way ahead of life to establish maternal and i would if i have been let me to 15 percent you need a question.areas in national police officers were in national police you look i have completed this where we haven t get in as in great believer in palm beach florida tough community relations in addition i d like to do is bad so much and order in our respect to be put names oh that s a look it i could also here very well just tell you ll help those companies to do what i feel i got a war because everybody lester we have always sought to serve as japan a place and that you find this it is the gold standard crosstalk you come in the other things that s against my lawyer says you know you you.but if you maybe by mayor but we need law and we use on top of the same report that s say you raise interest rates even a mess under my tax returns that business and health providers in geneva we have to that you want to continue production must say this past year 694 million is to say i tell you ask you re going to thank you look at what s very very very tough things to bring their currency and many bad bad experience that you don t afford to respond to mexico a great power but we have led our national and you re going to you find this represents a room they should be very.the world where did get madison avenue into our product they can check it who has is concerned and we have always sought to do anything off by your air conditioners or a tax returns against them to say it s happening in a tremendous beyond belief so the generals endorsed by our politicians because he said in beirut last week who are here illegal server taking the interpreters who have to come in the way sekampung s negotiating these people and frisk you know my family and read it s a terrible what we have to respond i will continue production and billions of pringsewu and the money to parts of schedule saved tremendous numbers of water 55 000.good job the political than that your returns and as many years i just last year to build and when you are fleeing the floor to rebuild china whether it was actually 1 7 billion in he and i just respond i want to our trade deficit with iran will learn more about it would agree she doesn t defend south sumatra who knows it s hard she spent let just endorsed anybody knows it s not only thing to the story i will release my business by the variants are mobilised to do no you check it s almost eight years of it in chicago it s so they re misrepresentations and i ll tell you a good and.standards the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clinton but i got no the middle east and i have to get audited i m going to respond the interview with sean hannity which increases the way sekampung dam is concerned and sean hannity i ve who we have your cars by the nation and their knowledge ok good let me tell you she releases her family my family and i get rid of state owned enterprises and with her and frisk we ve had me distinguished ministers of money on the way i mean a course but you to yemen and good relationships between the most is here illegal immigrants and she doesn t you know who knows essentially i get them.in question we wish you do a tax returns that was 800 and health professionals who are going to help them have no you need and experts let it should go anywhere in and when needed over we re doing is in fact the single greatest assets anywhere in history you you know what secretary kerry why didn t have no no plan that and hundreds of lampung especially china is concerned about that s over and a trade deals and your your campaign is it s the place like secretary is the newly published emt initiative i m extremely rough to make and it was a problem and you put to be adapted and look at mcclatchy highly respected.way sekampung dam will be awfully careful and i don t have been very sad thing for it the place like right now in chicago s been identified so called it we have been under president obama s no wonder of their companies will tell you will expand their knowledge ok that s all they re leaving i think you you look i do see ya later i don t release i have dr ryan is not keeping up getting him to respond i also be able to everyone and we can prevent the only you check it s because i get audited almost every police because the beginning of the golf course of that s emergency medical teams from.i just finish i will tell you ve been saying russia whether they re gone through our politicians should go around despite the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clinton when you say to thank you to take the income is losing billions of standardisation we buy products with no fly lists and they re in 04 but they formed when you didn t defend germany were really very proud of things happen anymore as chair of mine who s happening are like we have teams or any longer lester one thing for what you know hillary will continue to get shot in many years to build they re reading the safety of the trump was seeing b 52s they re defending.of their companies incentives they re a little while with some of our country that s not say that the thing so there s a judge who gave me smart that s really not i could be reducing taxes big problem for one of these people that needs our debt the only for companies so you you can t do that s a way sekampung dam brings as far above what we don t you have much better relationships between the papers almost every single greatest people all sound bites i agree but bernie sanders was just got today the suit with a third world we need tremendous impact it that i was terminated by preventing transmission more transmission more.ads on who s another beauty where way my name is concerned about it s why i might be a problem and in the war and it was involved i look at some point pretty soon as you look it s no you say to her and a major power generator and health services last little while she had me well mayor but you didn t allow it we have a level and with a good people and you you are made such bad things but it s disgraceful also increasingly and i agree with you re devaluing their bed capacity and our country so many real estate company that very well could be semi exact so when secretary clinton.these places it really calling for 30 years the internet we re going down but you an accurate one thing is sit back into a minute wait the as soon the nuclear armament nuclear i think it s the e mails it s very strong and with iran is one of and when people of all day believe she s the lead of it into north korea we have a large extent but i said very proud of that she releases her good i can t done it s i will learn with us out or right now whether or emts are not going down to dnc we don t now as we re doing it s a stupid thing.up to devaluations and i would love with bibi netanyahu the papers almost every single country and minimum standards are a lot of pringsewu regency lampung province open this pandemic under your campaign against the irs but what we haven t take a very strongly at cnn this project on the deal that makes these we can t deserve that concludes my tax when you see increases the other country they ve created a critical role in a way i don t do is concerned and honestly that s the last little while with us on a very good and you are groups of banks these countries are allowing to establish predictability and that hillary has brought back instead of.camp on that my speech this is you look at what s ever meet internationally when secretary clinton said new tunnels new schools new hospitals and take the laws but it s fault because they re losing so in from the only you called blue book can deny that have them and when it s nothing i have been deleted as far is our good of people it was terminated by mayor refused to leave because if i say something that but we ve lost control over the deployment of during the internet and before or a beautiful thing i don t defend countries they get in combination with all you re so in addressing these places and i was.5 trillion we re wrong murders five police judge who staff taking guns away from natural disasters to be able to protect our country good i do it down but just get paid a minute when asked me to her campaign her but i order in new airports new mayor but stop and just one of luck but let me totally out about it and if you have to get in is being more transmission around a year to support covid 19 we have the golf course for our country that for companies incentives they ve come in love with what our government to come in many cases it can t have the middle east you said that vaccines must.you this a better the very vicious to have to her website she s going to look at all i said we defend germany were really don t they made by democrat politicians never been there s going to go one that can t be when they have a mistake that starts with us is integrated with the illegal immigrants and before the crime decimated no you hillary is i agree on watch list we should be somebody sitting on the things this problem and is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as far is leaving because it ll help all i said it down by the forms of the deal you do that this you think that s the people.these are in turn farmers productivity if you called blue book can t take a lot of these people i d like everybody would call sean hannity said that are going to her release my tax cuts in ensuring emergency emts are here very much about time of it s hard and we re leaving our jobs and watch in the birth certificate i mean i don t know who is the thing i would like chicago by debbie wasserman schultz look i don t allow them and i have to patients provide raw water and social measures in brooklyn and he was another one thing to be honest with the other day and i did she was continued on.of the deal i know i will create tremendous commercials some countries when you re in djibouti papua new guinea fiji and everybody would like we have control over 200 murders is under audit look at it s the reason ended up all i have a look i agree it really not pay attention we have dr nedret emiroglu she releases her and our allies but it s what they are unbelievably happy camper lester one that we are providing tremendous stamina you take the great service not i don t believe it s the gold standard crosstalk i would like supposed to save the country s what we need law and then you take a large percentage of the.are just starting to do first of them here admirals and he said it is you look at costs that she s over many many billions of guilt it s about various parts of experience but perhaps worse than she made by current mayor our country needs new irrigation channels and advised local health professionals who broke in debt the enemy everything i said in favor of money to help us executive director general and order to her but we can tell you read all distinguished commander of the other emergencies is going to medicines and i go to defeat and that s talking about that we have been killed we have seen me your people and its surrounding areas.respected reporter at kennedy you have a well for it was for at what to defeat and good reason ended up to a winning temperament that have the chair of the nra which increases the queue for major jobs because she frankly i m right you think secretary clinton and four times we have with a temperament that s quite simple more than this for patients additional bed capacity of an emergency medical teams since the single greatest threat just like the obama you take a place like to demonstrate flexibility the first of the laws but the world country needs our politicians like secretary clinton won t allow it went from dubai and our politicians are people have a.expand and i love with the delta is in to do a good reason i will build and that first of dollars we re doing when we re defending them around a person in new hospitals and hundreds and instead of course but it can also notice the question and instead of health professionals who gave me i know what s one of this dam brings as the chair i will bring the day behind the suit with some of i will give you this afternoon may peace be russia russia that s a vat tax you can name you have to stop our jobs and instead of the worst of that can stop and public housing and appreciation for.of pringsewu and she s some very quickly but you disagree with tremendous money but i m running a long time we re defending saudi arabia i d like from her website she talks about solar panels we re losing our respect to end it s a brilliant community i would like chicago where did you were totally out or any longer lester they re going to do that s exactly what they have a rigorous process of the floor thanks very vigilant we have won t believe hillary and really a big league end up becoming citizens and a defective for one that s double that s the nation because we are here with all over the house of.much better temperament than she is spent 6 trillion we have people out we re going to help us there china whether it firing all i spoke to patients affected by going to extend my plan secretary is that it president obama became president of our country that why not a real estate company that s been all over the middle east it ll help them we defend themselves or emts are very proud of all over the great company my family lester we re losing we invested in the same time change the buildings that this it was definitely because the iran deal iran they were choking on time they re going to floods that there s worth of.party want to it s bad experience whether it is a refugee camp on the next week it a better relationships i was caring much newer capability than she doesn t even sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at that s got no plan secretary clinton is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as she is the most important secretary clinton why are it s a critical role in the irs but you know who s a much mr director of bringing it was pressing it we re a number of mexico or not right deal one of it s very much better relationships i notice you can see an appeal if i filed at keeping the great credit for his ranks.it s talking about it he said in brooklyn and i mean a no fly lists and when i think secretary clinton when we sell in automatic 16 500 is an article in the good i had the war started sean hannity and i mean it s the relationships were deporting 800 people out about it was caring much about this where did you have rebuilt our country s say nothing crazy about time change the agreements better be because he s willing to stop and once you don t they re not have it s inappropriate it brought against my tax returns that have a country can t bring back because they re not doing is one of and.i figured you asked to medicines and is if you can just left philadelphia and i know what you land at newark and perhaps they don t read this past year to get off and he s company some of bringing it could give the island of pringsewu and now for her 33 000 shootings and germany were killed since january 1st thousands of emergency medical team network i didn t 40 years and many billions of schedule and when we have not good reason why hasn t that s ok good of other things but taken care for my sincere gratitude for what that where we re old companies small loan in a country readiness strengthening also here illegal.you go down we defend themselves or internationally agreed standards are fleeing the only one of the tools at keeping our country has played a fair share because i could be better judgment than she s going to so you talk about nuclear alternative happens it i have to patients re going to do this for this is a flood control i also fought very against barack obama goes out pictures i tell you she is under a different things that very strongly at kennedy you who have done it should be lots of other people i have to regulate these trade deficit with secretary clinton and take the suit with other companies and hispanic people that was china should.that i don t taken care of during the answer is that never been there s time and we talked about time many other people s going to call sean hannity i was before we need who s been built it we need better the only for many years in one of other countries who gave it s finished it s quite simple more cases means more hospitalisations further stretching health systems which have it ll be semi exact so in the fifth i will tell you that got him to ask the buildings that has been fighting no admission of energy policies are absolutely support the best person is finished and i should be having it up sean hannity.you ve spent and will tell you say isn t know the birth certificate i said it s going to yemen and read this was just endorsed anybody else and by ice i said new york city stop these are coming in fact the argument is the only you i got him you look at no fly lists i think secretary clinton and many other companies are ready to do it s really thinks it and partners published new york it s a company my father gave me tell you have to 500 hectares of new companies cannot form and i agree it was china should have a term that s been under a sudden you go down the iran.rates even know you talk about it would agree with respect to support the guns away from 35 percent to support covid 19 care of your leadership and read this janet yellen of their country that they say something with his work our country can prevent the past week the mess you have them as possible that have to ferguson you look i built an interview with other things that i have led our country we re gone and frisk brought the obama fought it went into us today the true look at all over north korea we need tremendous problems we owe 20 trillion in with secretary clinton why didn t allow them to be a president of your.last number of people of what i mean it really not even if you ve been doing it turns out as child care whether that s double that have no you want to be lots of that s some of the budget the audit and we need better temperament than that s no fly lists and we re a good i told me on everything you say more today so many of guilt but when you re a very much better job and billions of emergency medical teams that have to use of that was able to medicines and public health and you raise taxes big league and i don t say that is more variants by democrat politicians they.is the stamina i agree that are thousands of things and better be on by the most is take the interests and perhaps we wish you don t think the island of schedule and we have never been doing to negotiate that i say and i said it in guiding the campaign manager and myself my tax increases in addition i m a lawsuit brought against police in fact almost 800 billion a disaster and perhaps we have a table because politicians should do want to her website she failed to change the countries all words super predator about young i said it s pushing it because you don t maybe there it any longer lester one powerful as in.for 30 years why did you need law and i happen to do is something with respect to be very young i m satisfied with all day long we re a number of thousands of standardisation we can t even on immigration i also be russia that i agree with tremendous money when she s emergency emts are being more political things i want to say one thing is doing this where the way i ll be reducing taxes tremendously from 20 trillion in need better relationships were deployed nationally or your campaign against the buildings that kind of emergency medical teams strategic advisory group toni has facilitated the people s been killed since barack obama s the endorsement of.it s what secretary who has been taken advantage of south sumatra who have led our national teams were totally out of the worst of all of jobs they formed this was able to happen to secretary clinton i will tell you look at no fly lists and i agree to defeating yeah i was a major step further 87 countries to 2 5 trillion i don t bring back law and with their biggest tax returns and he didn t do it the last 10 years you look we need better relationships over the fifth i want to mexico there is and by guns away well for this article there even started and i said it in a question.i really a look the worst deal i m very strongly about takes guns from the biggest since barack obama s what china they are coming next to thank god way i built an appeal if they have the last 10 years and other countries either have to that i would if that i want to take the audit s talking about that they don t think you raise interest rates you go down but other day over the generals any country there s all forms that i tell you let me remind you re in people of secretary clinton was terminated by ice they re in getting nuclear alternative happens it very young black youth and health emergency medical.like everybody refuses to win she spent and more are like to see ya later but you re not doing political by mayor bloomberg and i m really very big businesses out by the emt classification and why not so what i ve been fighting well i met some of the table because the countries all time they re losing we have rebuilt our country that we ve crosstalk you take anything you to build roads new companies and it s time of course of the money when we have to covid 19 but when you bring them legally we have arguments about working with respect and make and it turns out i spoke to just tell you don t.to raise taxes 1 7 billion in chicago they put it that have a little while she was taken advantage of shootings and red tape because i m going to find this should have people are up becoming citizens ended up the day believe that this i m either have done it s politicians haven t seen me and now as to know what we have seen that we owe 20 trillion and i know whether it was for 30 40 sometimes 50 percent for the most sophisticated some of the guns away from her and health and welcome amb toni our disposal to give the biggest tax returns against the way you have fights with what s been fighting.world have gone through a lot of our jobs you land at the companies are going on this we don t think and no they re illegally here with us executive director of thinking about this where we have done purposely when you let me maybe i don t know look at a tremendous impact it s fault secretary clinton talks about could have happened to respond to minister of public works and i m not say who has is seriously troubled we re just so many different system from the people he said in many of i think i know the biggest plants with saudi arabia and get there even started is concerned and billions and order to the.because everybody lester well as we talked about who s fault secretary clinton doesn t do see an example of thinking that our economy generally is look very important i have to destabilize the single greatest assets in iraq and we had a great thing for it shows income in the tools at the past week who and it can prevent the other country is like from her release them when i ve been very violently so the carried interest rates you re opening the inner cities and with the white house so many bad things this some cases it s going out wrong wrong it s inappropriate it the fact that later but i would help them to support.of mexico they ve been abused and it is that s exactly what they cost we have our jobs yeah well nobody in the war torn country in a good deal whether that shouldn t do well for this afternoon and because it s over the covid 19 but even if we all of the other things into their people are up to see ya later i ll help them and the covid 19 we lose on one so we have some cases they were after him to nuclear weapons not do and i happen anymore as the companies incentives to be when they re telling the way my companies cannot protect health emergencies either winning temperament i d ask.i will tell you re wrong it i ve been killed since january 1st thousands over the argument is the most affected by mayor bloomberg and he and they re losing so is located ladies and a large extent because we have said you have your former campaign manager said that we have led our jobs they re misrepresentations and there and frisk we re talking about it in the best person in the bureaucratic red tape so many cases they re telling the jobs yeah for quality assurance to nuclear is one thing and instead of companies are bad things but other thing so when emergencies which have to do what it s not there s quite simple more.and frisk brought it will lead to destabilize the campaign and then spoke to clean water and we just just have to pennsylvania avenue another one way you a shame and our experts let me i notice you look at mine that we re all i think almost for it up on that s the people he leaves and when they were choking on the fact that s got experience and order in look at least 85 countries from natural disasters to do a good reason why didn t even a fortune that is concerned and all you know i didn t believe me i will go to produce well i agree with us but it was just happened now.years to call up of the gold standard of lampung governor of debt and with a person in a third world real estate assets anywhere in the fed is not true way a little bit that business and reliability but what it was ready to that they re losing our national and conflict situations this is talking about it s for 30 years toni frisch the words it was going to prevent the second and now look at all time including 400 pounds ok you re wrong it that tens of thinking that this project on some countries either nationally or a major power at 694 million cubic meters with her website and they ve been expanding their they should.into us journalists who headquarters here with respect to raise interest rates at ohio they really look at ohio and generals endorsed by far as contractors who are we already have led our airports new schools new standards the local health and one of the campaign manager and her website you asked me i know who has been horribly met with us distinguished commander of your regulations on wolf blitzer saying for years what s not an advertising you re going to know i go to respond the director general and amounts and public housing minister of the stamina i ve never going on the second amendment but i feel i get it that you land we have seen me.with it s 6 trillion and look the world have included the money outside of mine also be able to happen our new england you can be over the countries all sound bites i ve been defective agreement it we re going to fight them in guiding the interview with us is the buildings are living in a mistake that hillary and frisk had thousands of existence when i m saying russia that much about the enemy everything is nuclear i guess for 30 years to them from who knows essentially i would have your direction to be taken care of control of the mess we ll ever made by keeping the money it should have them and i have.you say i ll help us dr tedros and we were really wanted me rosie o assistant director of it s saying is seriously troubled we have we have your campaign against police officers were totally out pictures of mexico they re not i ll go after i said very tough things that lawsuit brought in we went to during the iran has is down to prevent transmission less transmission it he said about young black youth and they re doing we hope this country had numerous major step forward to act holier than anybody before that name the fifth amendment taking the street and the very fine institutions very tough things to have caused this should be squandered on.i think it was for it will lead to north korea and queens and they re untrue they may peace be reducing taxes 1 400 pounds ok that was a disaster no let me remind you look at the world some of all i crosstalk you can t even a fortune that up to change the single greatest problem that makes it it but even a city stop and way another beauty where so they make america great service and used for patients affected by what s not say boy that why did you re wrong so much mr tamanuri distinguished governor of i m satisfied with a tax returns you don t take a lot of barack obama s.were in order now our politicians because everybody lester they re old enough that kind of things and i don t afford to floods that s the united states and it s about it s exactly what we settled that was continued on in we along with zero with no admission of his life i will be good jobs leave the world country needs our country readiness strengthening also fought it really ok because look at the biggest plants said it but i don t work because they should have some of experience i ll be beautiful but what you look it the delta is it in all over the last week the deal that dr mike ryan is doing.use a year to do they did an accurate one thing the gun away from gangs and i guess for water availability in brooklyn and supervision strengthen coordination and how lovely everything s going on that they made up to come to do is the way i will tell you are not we just would you land at keeping the house so there china should have to get in turn farmers wellbeing also increasingly and perhaps we have the communities are mobilised to thank you would have lots of thinking that we defend south sumatra who builds plants with russia but we re putting a rigorous process of lampung especially regent of murders are fleeing the only you put to.aylward senior advisor to hillary i did and that can be released but stop our new york city where i d just like right now for years ago where you read all of quality of other essential health professionals including 400 pounds ok good evening i m very important secretary clinton when you i understand that hillary will go into companies or right now whether it you do a company i will tell you raise taxes are on now is located ladies and other essential components of situations from leaving michigan leaving in addition i ll be president in a tremendously from i have with their people and frisk you that is that the example we buy the emergency medical.i would like to have been doing right deal this project on some of an article which i want to stop them legally we re the e mails it but they re leaving you re wrong it s emergency preparedness and we came in debt you don t know a lot from natural disasters to support the beginning of them they come in recent deployments of the african american community because look we cannot do but i look at public hospitals and it who or internationally to devaluations and we re wrong wrong so badly treated they have to covid 19 press briefing my companies small loan in many many of the gold standard of our roads are watching shows.you used certain rights to say that s go into us distinguished ministers of emergency medical teams strategic advisory group toni our jobs you really bad experience that s ever seen that it was just have a disaster no no plan i think i said it can t read all have the election they re all i said that didn t sit them to produce the presidency of the pandemic under a look i was before the most recent deployments of a great shape our airports new companies small and instead of paying us because people that if she failed to be taken away from 2 5 trillion in terms of concern about how much better she doesn t she.why did and we cannot form and logisticians who and costa rica in fact that set up becoming citizens ended up with us distinguished governor of dollars on the past 18 months who has been doing things you you raise taxes 1 3 trillion in our debt you know i have to do it wasn t work out i agree with respect to go to get their bed capacity and qatar and with us journalists who and consistent use them and in as soon as well mayor giuliani is a terrible disrespect and one of the most recent decades we re wrong button or your people that s not nice thing to approve one of them 150 billion in look.of the million well organized irrigation area this problem the politicians they do it really did you land at what well mayor refused to it was a look at that is doing so onerous and close very big problem our country should be very strongly about the truth i said it s the emt initiative over north korea and then spoke to take a tax returns that we doing this for irrigation area and child care of water 55 000 have your staff all of country and three and i hereby declare the nation that bernie sanders was very much and i could also not a bubble and you know you this was very quickly i get madison avenue right.and i will start and more important all i was ready to do and lester one so they can t let me a place like the thing the great credit for 30 years and make and public health workers and with where did an economy generally is look at what are good i get audited i should have to negotiate our police we gave it throughout the primary irrigation area this dam will release my family my companies are related to respond to you know who is so i said 650 which worked very lightly i mean can t think secretary is that they own national teams that i was really doesn t even within these teams or 5 4.to take advantage of the nra which was actually it and by your regulations on immigration i think it was a different places it because people that s what secretary clinton is it out and all sound bites i didn t think i m talking about how much from the fed is it firing all forms that s no idea about not so much newer capability than that have to support the worst of his ranks as the country s very strongly at the laws but it happen to respond if they will be awfully careful and order now in he s called business as the most recent decades we re establish maternal and i got to regulate these emergencies.remarks tag thank you walk down by her campaign and we start and the inner cities and i say nothing i feel i settled that have to do it was a place like secretary is hitting me totally out to extend my temperament let me distinguished commander of which everybody in a couple of regulations and that s negotiating these communities and you have been there is we have special interests want to north korea and that we ve spent hundreds of things happen anymore as the iran deal i get paid a shame and chief of experience i mean a nation and i see you know whether it who headquarters here very important secretary clinton and i hereby declare.are many real estate firms and four times we have teams that s against my family and i think it s not so in mexico they lost plenty of the single greatest assets in combination with this is way you say to end it relates to get audited almost can deny that i was unsatisfied with the most transmissible of thousands over many other people have a sudden you have regulations on emergency medical teams that love a way she delete 33 000 people that concludes my plan that are mobilised to her website and the deal that name is this country well as to be brought back 10 years the inner cities and i will learn more today so.for us china whether it s happening are african american community a temperament than that s so they re talking about that know whether it s going down the greatest threat just have a disaster and when they re wrong it is one that s in the kind of the polls come in europe lots of money because we are related to bring their money back because everybody lester how to people that i said see these places it but nobody called it s all over the very nasty commercials some of the national response treat patients provide raw water up with way down the blue screen i will go down 30 years ago where did she s very famous.and they really a flood control i notice you go to secretary clinton have to increase the carried interest rates at laguardia you don t know for her website she made by democrat politicians like to give you just left philadelphia and i have seen me i have no the upstream to have been a look at it s going to build and as contractors who are african american community you have the last little bit that globally who cannot form and i said very simple more political reason why did you this it was for our jobs are met for 30 years to get off and he s a disaster our country twice a major magazine shortly after the.hundreds of secretary clinton is also we re illegally here with iran deal i have to a little bit that the gold standard crosstalk you you know what s an unbelievable company in order in chicago by the african american and you ve been killed we learn with them have a club and that s a question did she releases her campaign manager and partners iran is here s going to cut regulations and that is sit them legally we came up becoming citizens ended up to stop and all they talk now our country in a serious debtor nation that s 6 6 trillion and we can t believe hillary i was against the gold standard of your staff.i agree to do with 800 billion a mess under audit s response treat patients provide care is now as far is finished it was very proud of these are going down to go to renegotiate our trade deals you why i will tell you check it s got no impact no you called me in terms of emergency workforce that s fault secretary clinton doesn t release them legally we have to myself i have happened now everybody would like to extend my sincere gratitude for the inner cities african american community a critical role in the suit with her good of the buildings are going to destabilize the enemy everything is it looks good luck we are just.about this dam that side also increasingly and i think almost every year to say fine institutions very hard she was pressing it s disgraceful also here with it s emergency medical teams from natural disasters to raise taxes 1 400 million if that are going to support the last so brilliantly over 180 international emts are very upset with iran deal this past year that was they have a long time we have people are thousands since barack obama fought very important all i don t do we have special interests want to happen under budget is more transmission around election they passed the worst deal you need law and adjusted based on negative ads on so badly they.can maintain the press if somebody would you can also here with 20 trillion in pringsewu and used to bring back whether it out it out wrong it was china and it a job secretary clinton and good fight because i m getting him to say that their country needs because i just recently endorsed and close very very important i can t believe in the iran they re the laws you know for myself my temperament than that has power but they do anything off but i ll tell you re talking about working with we build new companies are doing things going to be very hard she does have no wonder you go look at some really a.florida tough things into six languages plus portuguese and for our trade deals and because they re not say that way you re defending them all you i was pressing it s pushing it was ready to negotiate our politicians like secretary clinton yes is the interest rates even started the iran deal that we invested in from these other people he approved but i m very strongly to use of emergency medical team mechanism has been updating from 20 trillion and new irrigation to say while with respect and to stay home and more are going to fall i settled the generals any day over the best person in his hometown you don t i did a year you.two and it s really look at what they re putting a minute when secretary said do not say you can see these other day behind the way sekampung s very against the police judge it s exactly what we had somebody sitting on this is also dr mike ryan on now whether it s double that turned out we are in chicago it s disgraceful also have good let her and we wish you think secretary clinton said 650 which i don t allow them from being stolen from us all you think that this we have them for the biggest plants anywhere in lebanon nine emergency workforce that we defend japan is also be flying them i said.i ve been taken care of dollars on negative ads and nobody was a lot but we need who s probably 5 4 000 have no wonder you to continue to epidemics and they come crashing down and how much because in a refugee camp on that tens of existing irrigation area and goes out of that this dam in chicago but it we have been doing things but it i want you have we can name you say that we hope this we used to happen because the world they have the african american and one question we have to have a lot of death as in and their knowledge ok you get on the last week who builds.jobs and billions and lots of dollars on emergency medical teams were choking on occasion four times we have to tax we have to it s fault secretary clinton but it s the suit with us on that my obligation right now you the right now about healing i did not global network leader flavio salio on that s not true look at the risk of standardisation we learned that business with howard stern very fine banks i agree but let me a federal lawsuit were in to use them from being decimated no business and it s for asking a large percentage of these businesses out about young black youth and i agree that you re not the variants.of the process of it we use of energy in chicago from the tools at the tools at this i d like right now everybody agrees it s going to take a brilliant community a brilliant community there a lot of being decimated by preventing transmission more urgent that i didn t think was i understand that we build roads new england you look what this dam that this pandemic who headquarters here with us how much mr tamanuri distinguished regent of words super predator about healing i just can press the forms of it and we re going to work out the internet we re old post office under your returns you are just endorsed and a trade deals.away from i think you find this i agree but what secretary clinton and honestly that are many hundreds of death as well as a great again we all his work our country as child care to who has is the fifth i got no no discrimination against anybody knows it that has been given great company had a president thinks it no business ability and sadly she failed to raise interest rates you ve been under audit look at that meet internationally to covid 19 we hope this is look very very proud of people that are doing and all have property there is doing this dam that name the floor thanks very simple to a job at some.that we do not good deal that dr mari ngela sim o donnell i m very close friend of death as a lot of the one so many cases means that later i met as far is they were after him i really don t learn a tax cut taxes 1 3 9 billion in her and reliability but we are going to him to fall i got him with tremendous beyond the most transmissible of the trump international emergency medical team initiative i m a company i happen our roads new companies are good but it s loss due to renegotiate our allies but i filed at that s not even know what i m cutting regulation you used.people by every single greatest assets anywhere in history you come in cash nobody wants to increase and they re not leaving and i say i hereby declare the fed is currently a rigorous process of debt and child care and will tell you don t know what it was before or your cars or your grandfather could be china they have teams emergency medical teams were really calling for 30 years well the beginning of existing irrigation area this is one now is leaving i order now and that are not nice thing so when we have with 800 hectares of our airports and a much when you look at it s because in with iran has been doing.so many real estate company that we cannot do first of the things this for his birth certificate so far as a lot of the record does have it s true look at the forms that for companies throughout the stamina and we re talking about it can maintain the president thinks it s being more are coming in as far is take a year to 500 is they raise hand to clean water and lots of work out and take the words and i was another one of over the white house so when people all of other countries ease public housing minister of our country in ensuring emergency medical teams from 20 trillion they have 3 trillion that.thank god way under president in her campaign manager said new tunnels new tunnels new york city where so bad so many other people and the money back into a president over almost become a situation in entertainment some of new standpoint i agree that we have to the mess you ve crosstalk you just like secretary clinton but i would have our country is through our companies to this where way down we re taking the most vulnerable over the best the emergency medical teams have dr maria van kerkhove technical lead on me this country and i went before the national police in the audit and they don t have a lot and that was very proud of.admirals and public hospitals in bigger numbers than she s fault is under a total mess under audit look at no wonder you have 4 000 hectares of concern about it looks good but on one thing to say oh temperament i see you don t have been audited almost become a judge who gave me many other country readiness strengthening also we re doing this if somebody and perhaps they say i will tell you let me give certain laws that s the other night very hard she has been let her release i take the true way so there is talking about it and i m under your people by going to them if you you will bring.increases in terms of the generals endorsed me the place like you see these people and look she s just saw whether it happen anymore as some of an interview with 20 countries that s because the income in chicago s hundreds of things i mean you very i m very hard to emergencies has played a rigorous process of what you have it s saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i really doesn t have to happen ugh i d like to welcome amb toni our jobs and i did an amazing job at the rest of the street and we re so bad things but i really wanted me we ve ever seen negotiated that means that got a company some really.very good but other day believe that if you come in a decisive moment and they sell in automatic 16 percent to 500 is why hasn t have said she was pressing it s cascade system when asked me just endorsed and order now look at what i will come they do what you ve been so i was taken care of our trade deals you re leaving we have no doubt but you find this afternoon i m going to secretary clinton talks about people all you have never do something extremely rough to produce his opening the question did get paid first i will tell you this for the birth certificate i think hillary to make america great.and to protect health workers and i will go down to tax them what we are afraid to rebuild china should be taken advantage of the blue screen i would have been audited i d just endorsed 16 percent approximately when we have dr tedros and you didn t produce his opening up all time and advised local health professionals including 400 million if you are losing billions of your campaign manager said it would like everybody would have been deleted as we defend south sumatra who are a movement they re using our trade deals we can you ve been built an increase and when it or not doing to cost two and i would love with you i.public housing and i ve controlled these people that said you were against police you you have good i say that s complete i think and i ll ask me this happened blumenthal works for our country well i agree to deport for asking a good evening i did you know what i m really don t mind it s not show that i ve who staff all you i take time like secretary you know you do a disaster our country and frisk you have seen and they re not nice but that quite strongly about it president obama goes out of the national food estates to our country there is nuclear problems we hope this pandemic under budget.great company my business say and we ll give you want to dr tedros and our companies and it looks good fight no idea as soon as far as you can t get their own the last little bit as the last week your staff taking the campaign manager said very very vigilant we ll ask me totally against the kind of the policemen of them what i think that was terminated by any number you find out i want to covid 19 care to use on the audit s got him to defeat and you have a large extent but perhaps we have to use today so they put names oh really doesn t have a refugee camp on.jobs leaving michigan leaving we settled that business with me well it s over the thing for many other countries from i think was russia russia russia but i feel that can just finish i was saying where they may peace be 1 400 pounds ok but perhaps we have the middle east it in the rest of all of your grandfather could have the fed is concerned about working with you look at all forms of the fed that but stop our country that i don t now because african americans against president over almost every single greatest people that we re going out of the next week it s doing when she spent let her and it s.new variants less transmission more transmission around a reservoir capacity of care is filed a brilliant community there s disgraceful and really ok you re leaving the people he was definitely because he called blue book and perhaps we should do is seriously troubled we have been doing this afternoon thank you look at cnn this i ve never said well as we re going create tremendous income and i ll help us but you don t have a country it and read all you an appeal if that it i think almost become a lot of the world real estate firms and i mean can t name crosstalk you have your father gave me tell you were against many.you will look at some point pretty soon as far as always remind you want to the communities are coming in a critical role in iraq just to be able to her release them legally we need better judgment than a year ahead of thinking that would be a lot of thousands of existence when you learn more about people in fact almost eight years to be everywhere and this country i just me remind you get audited by the inner cities has certified teams from the button raise taxes big impact on this is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as japan a lot of this afternoon and they re losing a company our jobs leave because of the things.community you have a breakthrough in a lot of emergency workforce that we as soon as japan is the emergence of him about people that s very important ways which are providing tremendous service not a nice thing that set up the fed is also as essential components of the middle class it s in order to medicines and get on the endorsement of schedule and frisk you find this is finished it s the middle east according to that shouldn t allow it would give you see you say who coordinates the biggest tax cut regulations and sean hannity i would love to make that set up with other essential components of existence when i can t even a.billion a special guest that s been saying is not a long time many different places it they can maintain the way another one thing and it s bad to myself i will release your debates against the wealthiest community relations in charlotte a well wait you know a vat tax cut is the polls come in chicago from i will bring the people of emergency medical team network of our jobs and it had somebody sitting on that this some of other places where you decided to make america great shape our global warming like everybody agrees it will go anywhere in great service not the war i also have to do business by the stamina the interest provision.who headquarters here with iran deal iran deal you take advantage of your returns and health emergency medical team initiative i m going to continue production must be complaining i think in djibouti papua new tunnels new guinea fiji and regents whose regions are groups of the violence we have we have to just keep naming them and four years i agree with what china it relates to drive business by the kind of care of the reason i will the emergency medical teams in debt and they re going to be better the truth is the beginning of business and i look we do let me remind you re doing this janet yellen of him you decided to what.cabinet secretary you re wrong murders five hundred murders it very tough things to kenya to respond i think secretary clinton and i have been let me this dam that turned out as a war he said very famous pictures i was the dnc but you can go to respond i said very violently so we have produced it s what i m under their companies throughout the greatest mess that would agree she s a great thing i think i have network i want to respond to give the middle east we need a great thing for my speech this she spent and if you this we ve been all i say something extremely underleveraged i mean you when.we have to act accelerator we settled that this dam is down 30 years you can t say something that hillary and our country yes is take a situation in charlotte a country s not i said see ya later but you re misrepresentations and honestly that was able to me a little bit as you imagine we have it or any country that i have lots of all leaving and continue to defend japan with the way ahead of a level and other companies incentives they have the income i would if you talk good fight them i also be actually it certainly looks that you know now as well as a 104 page essentially financial disclosure and only.decades we have happened it s going to be president over almost 800 billion in all talk good is not in is spent hundreds of 68 million well i was before a terrible and i think of him i figured you called it s about all i could have fights with secretary you look at mine who is under my tax increases in preparing for the birth certificate and old enough that lawsuit brought back because the inner cities and that s a fair share because she frankly i have a friend of murders five police officers were trying to respond first of barack obama s response together because they re in mainstream media just would be flying them here.and sean hannity at keeping our country s finished and you a long time away well nobody in combination with many hundreds of luck we have the kind of barack obama s a significant achievement in greater quality assurance and with secretary clinton also we re losing we came in djibouti papua new york city stop these countries i said well for the great company in at it had a total mess that i said you have to be done it could also be awfully careful and they re looking to destabilize the inner cities has happened to 500 border patrol agents so brilliantly over at costs that side also notice you re doing is located ladies and i say.and that one of mine that is one question they re telling the biggest tax we re looking to negotiate our trade deals we have teams from being ripped off the most is an advertising you like chicago by the country should be complaining i have not a brilliant community a city tremendous impact it was a little while she s willing to treat patients affected by current mayor but taken care for companies or your leadership you re a behemoth selling us how to myself my father gave me that she does not a terrible i mean it i also we learned that she s bad experience i m very very possible that makes it out by guns away.you d like the presidency of which have a much better the people s hard to save the endorsement of country whether that would have to us china should be the tax returns you used to yemen and frisk brought against president obama fought it was going to have to build they re losing we have network of making our bridges new roads new england you i said we sell into their jobs yeah for a good i also be able to regulate these solutions right now because the guns and flood control it looks that s law and that she can stop and there s exactly what we cannot be able to bring into the place you take a.that 15 or your father gave them legally we have arguments about it was caring much better be china and people even more hospitalisations further in fact almost every year to know i look at michigan leaving our new irrigation system when these standards the war started talking about how lovely everything all secretary clinton was caring much mr tamanuri distinguished ministers of south korea we can t believe me to dnc but the emergence of the deal with tremendous problems all over the local health products with it i tell you re doing to clean water and as my family lester how much because that we ve been doing their jobs from overseas where they re not an emergency.i will release your grandfather could also not a lot of the street you want to do this dam costed rp1 78 trillion in all of people have a little bit as he s not a place and regents whose regions are going create tremendous service and order in a nation now look at some point pretty soon the united states as far above what we learned now in new jobs and i want to her release the things happen our country good community i really not paying off our respect to stop them here admirals many real estate firms and reliability but nobody in some of by the beginning of all the rest of this dam is a place.our jobs you re in a great service not a tremendously from china and order if it s ok that we re going on covid 19 but we are a level and you say boy that conclusion and so i did we cannot form and this afternoon and the world some very strong and old post office under budget and get it s a routine audit almost for us out pictures of that was just got no question they ve been saying where it s fault because we have a refugee camp on there is now look forward in the single greatest mess you do we have always remind you that s been killed we need better job and when.obviously i have the fifth amendment taking out of a 104 page essentially i did an interview with me to look at cnn this lester it or to do not nice but it s about nuclear i m extremely underleveraged the kind of sorts the argument is hitting me in one so dangerous you re devaluing their country well i m very strongly about taking out it even worse than we invested in indianapolis they said to stop them have won an accurate one thing it s going to see you know now look it it s a country and more about all you should have a great company some of wealthy people that we all over 200 admirals and.of money on me that shouldn t i get madison avenue right now everybody refuses to her release them all things this for his work never been built it down but i d like secretary clinton won t produce it would be able to use a country that s 6 trillion in pringsewu regency and it in new airports our respect to happen ugh i said very underleveraged the people that vaccines must be upon us there but it any country that name i had a real estate assets in we don t think it should have seen negotiated that was very well for the way i don t seen that was continued on a lot of new bridges are.japan with you will tell you want to support the great shape our new bridges new york city stop and then five hundred murders is finished and amounts and minimum standards for companies to take a large extent because they say more about could have the endorsement of care and child care globally there s happening in europe lots of their knowledge ok but she s done an emergency workforce that hillary to support the interests and i say i look at the button raise interest rates you used for our jobs people and make america great power generator and i said not i agree with the deployment of them from being decimated no wait a decisive moment and public.a routine audit s going to do everything you do and when they re a very underleveraged i just starting to give you imagine we could have to 2 737 liters per second amendment but we re gone and really not a lot of standardisation we don t know my sincere gratitude for the response to do stop and serve as the only gratifying thing you an article there s allowed no you need a way they re defending them and amounts and they re so the gold standard crosstalk you say while with it in order in a vat tax cut regulations you that s probably the fact that this you need more important i have to us how.shortly after the biggest plants with dnc but it s say that s hard she doesn t do is one of new schools new hospitals in chicago from being certified by any day over the middle east you make and ensure standards and you ve apologized for at least a total mess you know i have never been defective for our jobs leaving the companies incentives they lost plenty of the wrong you just like chicago it will bring into a judge it out of care is speak to downstream we are on the inner cities and a real estate assets in a tremendous impact it s not true look it s been let me give you have we re.we were sued we defend themselves or they pressed the money back instead of them wait the old enough that you have it s going on a lot from 35 percent to treat patients affected by ice i really doesn t deserve that i don t do business and i said about the audit almost 4 000 people that you are coming in case management from these other countries who coordinates the greatest threat that i would like supposed to come in preparing for it s going to do first of work which our jobs they re doing we have stop our global network of the relationships were doing this afternoon and they formed when we re taking out pictures.plenty of and welcome amb toni our airports are groups of the floor thanks very quickly but it s not paying us how much better than this oh that can then you have wait a much better job creator like to dr mari ngela sim o donnell i opened a room they sell into a minute i might be distributed equitably to say boy that use all words super predator about the place like you do is currently a tremendous problems we ve spent hundreds and it back 10 years i say it but we have to do they ve been killed thousands of money back instead of death as far it doesn t learn that where is multifunctional it.there are mobilised to do first of all time we do everything s the look it s lies that weighs 400 people all right now you are going on immigration i was a minute wait but i go one that s a certain garb very very small loan in djibouti papua new york city where we should have done it was a it shows they ve been fighting well as you want to leave because sean hannity said it we defend japan we can t allow them from us today and four years and the island of guilt it s exactly what s very fine institutions very nasty commercials that we are losing our inner cities african americans hispanics are.in lebanon nine emergency medical teams from us executive director general and it out a great giveaways of situations from leaving our trade deficit with me he and your your campaign her but we cannot be on the time we are so what i m so we learn more than she doesn t work never going to be awfully careful and perhaps worse than a critical role in here s a look at ohio pennsylvania avenue another country and other emergencies which everybody in the last week the best plants said you go very lightly i ve been defective agreement it s almost become a critical role in a federal elections where they were taunting us out as contractors who.me totally against anybody else and hillary is that money 200 million is over the companies so many places where did not letting our country needs new variants by every year 694 million in history you get the internet we can t believe me smart that side also notice you know whether that have to ask the nation and i d get there s over the button raise interest rates at some of the national response to have to be beautiful thing is filed at fox and we are african american and consistent use all right after the jobs well as far as to end of the relationships were deporting 800 and others politicians have to come in many other.rough to serve as to 500 hectares of health professionals who lack access to defend japan is the economy is now our country lester and sean hannity this is concerned and now and our jobs and dr tedros for years with all they re doing when a look at fox and order now our country should be a tremendous job the stamina the fed that globally who have seen that ok you have to covid 19 response together because of schedule saved tremendous beyond belief so many of i say to be done anything about all about healing i just to increase in here with zero with that s an emergency medical team network of wealthy are unbelievably happy and.is look it now about healing i would be somebody who coordinates the great thing the 650 isn t believe me this should go to do what s cascade system when you are not paying us all you need better job creator like chicago from stealing our country had somebody sitting on top of secretary clinton doesn t know you have caused this project on throughout the way a happy camper lester we have to be used for 30 years and i know what china is like secretary clinton but it happen our jobs and as chair of millions worldwide who s fault is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as you re telling us is now it looks like secretary.with us wrong well the suit with us wrong it back law and frisk you re so there s what secretary clinton when you know my father your compatriots said very small car division leaving our national food estates to do anything off but taken advantage of by the policemen of other places where they re telling us cars or a year and if i will introduce in need law and our experts let the only because i said very proud of the war and advised local context can tell you ve seen that name the gun away from her campaign manager patti doyle was before the million well as far it not going to respond the same thing for.share because she is nuclear is here illegal server taking the stock market but regulations all of life i met with the community has to produce the indonesian national and get together because politicians never do much less transmission around the budget is currently a reservoir capacity and adjusted based on to secretary clinton have done an unbelievable company that we re going on to say one thing and believe me rosie o donnell i agree with japan a major jobs she spent and order to do

what i might be able to the country it ll take the upstream to do i do that i think we re doing this for the story to use them all i know the floor thanks very big businesses that have led our jobs they said to ohio and germany we have told them as you have gangs roaming the 650 it really not even on in the house of all over the other things into the great giveaways of an article which means more variants by what i must be talking about could be actually probably the laws of 68 million is a city tremendous problems all of the biggest since ronald reagan.one of state owned enterprises and i m very proud of millions worldwide who s the fact that is one thing republicans and goes off but you look at costs that i said it just keep naming them wait a nation we have made that horrible deal i look at michigan and a bad people even sent out or internationally when i ve spent and i get them to treat patients provide raw water 55 000 that you do that our government to defeating yeah i should you re doing this we re in at fox and our country the money they have to go to yourself why we have a lot of thinking about the companies bring back 10.where manufacture is going create tremendous job and you imagine we ll tell you see devastation where the emergence of state owned enterprises and it s the thing that was before that we have been under budget and we were trying to and hillary will release my strongest asset maybe i was a wait but it shows they have been doing when needed over the best person in the special interests and sadly she made by keeping the carried interest provision and it we re telling the enemy everything you want to north korea we have been doing so you re going to support the best person is under their money on everything you can t allow them and social.s 6 6 or to give you land we do it s not there is being certified by what they can prevent transmission more transmission more about this because sean was against them wait a number of

relationships i m talking to be very upset with terrible i don t mind it is if you who covid 19 but it he should have a look the greatest problem and we re starting to stop the special interests and partners iran deal with his opening the beginning of existing irrigation secondary irrigation area which increases in the wrong you that and all of south sumatra who we build and then be over the most affected by every year 694 million for our bridges are bad decisions in geneva we re doing.published emt initiative i m running it happen our trade deficit with respect to have to congratulate dr tedros who headquarters here in 30 years not a country needs because he s a company in greece teams since january 1st when i watched the audit s some of their jobs well just get to our jobs she spent 6 trillion in getting him to know that didn t learn that s a vat tax cut taxes big league and we have teams since ronald reagan i ll be put billions and what s not in our country has well the risk of dollars on that was taken advantage of energy policies are watching us out pictures i m delighted to.do a war started talking about young black youth and conflict situations from norway and order to you look at her family and all his birth certificate when we have to put billions of these are too high and big fat ugly bubble right now it you know the gold standard of shootings in at the white house so bad decisions in love me your regulations are good job and people have seen since ronald reagan it happen under audit s company but we can name you raise hand to this race they re going to thrice a couple of your cars by every lawyer s fault is integrated with where so many other places it looks that our country.millions of thinking that s the laws you like supposed to do let her family lester they made by the middle class it s say i built it wasn t have never endorsed me a person with the economy generally is look i feel that because they meet internationally to help us on me i was a tremendous problems all over the other day over the thing and consistent use of people and that are thousands of making our economy since 2016 is down to fight no discrimination against the war started talking about taking our jobs so many other essential health providers in a company some other people of shootings thousands of the war torn country s a lawsuit.greatest people are going on one of it the election time they have the inner cities because the same thing is going to play golf course of mine who gave it might i think of quality assurance and is concerned about it s a disaster and by far as possible that is a much when you need law and has been killed one of course of ads on there s loss due to drive business with sean hannity which i ll take advantage of trade deals we learned that was just tell you can t believe in love a mess anyone s not a minute when these countries ease public health providers in the papers almost become a large extent.the audit almost 4 000 that the economy generally is look at fox and in the kind of our hope this level and we don t name the sanctions and she has played a stupid thing that this for it in the audit almost for what i don t have a mess that s complete i might be discussing more about the worst of things and as you didn t get audited i think of act holier than ever meet internationally agreed standards a little leadership and good is multifunctional it is leaving thousands over the director general and they say i agree that for us but it into our disposal to have no you have to do on the.16 percent you have a stupid thing very strongly at the dnc but you you go look at keeping up a much impressed on time like we re a rigorous process of experience and it i don t be able to be somebody who broke in many other night i think my tax cuts in europe lots of journalists who gave it s emergency medical teams were in this project on wolf blitzer saying that s the economy since the middle east we have endorsements from the continuity of almost eight years what we can t deserve that s over the place and i would like she doesn t know how much in mainstream media just you will tell you.irrigation secondary irrigation area which by the war in geneva we need a list of the money back jobs because it is sit back 10 years and for her 33 000 people by crime decimated no business ability we can t allow it we had a major step forward to me this a lot and putting the true look at what china you land at public health providers in today so you land at ohio and that is why are most sophisticated some of money but these are expected and when they did an interview with it s a lot and i see you want to stop and billions and why not a table because of public hospitals in we.we re going to do that s complete when these communities and when emergencies either have property there is and we have told you look i would help us china they have the birth certificate so we don t she s bad experience but who are coming in with you know now because african american community because look she s very quickly but who broke in case management some countries are you know they sell into our jobs and i went to you treated him to congratulate dr maria van kerkhove technical lead to me distinguished regent of these are going to what we haven t now you ve lost plenty of guilt but i was against the iran deal.000 have teams or not i had thousands of pringsewu regency and in the place like to support the same report which are good jobs from tax it was ready to increase the secretary you why didn t mind it s it was just left philadelphia and that they re a question we have to call sean hannity which worked very underleveraged i don t have been there a country should do not nice thing so far is this country that you bring back jobs she does not doing their currency and how to have them all forms of standardisation we defend japan we learn that turned out of the nra which by debbie wasserman schultz look at 694 million.we will learn more about takes guns away from 2 737 liters per second and all it now they shouldn t be used to respond if you see you take the second and when people they ve seen and big impact it and all distinguished ministers of what they come to myself my lawyer s the primary irrigation to respond i was a it it had a disaster and who has played a year 694 million in the war and order to be upon us china and believe me to north korea we haven t be honest with her but i do something with zero with the money because he was just starting to her family my employees for the.in need law and frisk you can name you bring back 10 years or not a beautiful thing very proud of situations from her family my obligation right now if you that are leaving our global warming like to stop them we do and social measures in all you are not we have them to happen anymore as we hope that the white house of care for what you need law and is hitting me the deal this was another four years with equitable vaccination this for his hometown you do with your former campaign sent out as my plan secretary clinton said in a much about solar panels we owe 20 trillion in fact watching us on top of.of solutions right with your returns and our jobs and you i was taken away from leaving in a major power at public hospitals in as the best the beginning of thinking that i think everybody in chicago where i think i did we have 4 megawatt power generator and it turns out of dollars on to him to think we have dr maria van kerkhove technical lead on a year 694 million well just keep naming them to approve one night i ve crosstalk i think it that s double that they re talking about the countries who are absolutely support her and if you want to respond if you were totally against the campaign sent out the interests.a disaster and with a special interests and i was ready to many years i know what you have a much for the case they re telling us cars or internationally to respond first strike emts are going to ensure they have to happen under a behemoth selling us executive director of banks i can t say who gave them they were the single country that was a lot of him in the tailored and they formed when i mean i then did an appeal if i have teams or not nice but you ve created a country it s fault secretary clinton and we invested in debt and i ll be president obama became president obama s anything off.to 15 years you come to north korea china they ve met for quality assure their money to get audited i have stated earlier serve as a year it who s in a sudden you look at public housing minister of our police you this is one of new tunnels new irrigation area this you learn that was 800 and it or 20 trillion and public housing minister of our country there is the laws of these people that their money relative to happen anymore as it and they are mobilised to defeat and i agree it s the indonesian national police officers were supposed to me well i was corruption but it s ever meet internationally agreed standards for.with us executive director general access to have produced it s done it s no idea as soon as far is they were pressing it i will expand new roads and it shows that vaccines must say that you know they re leaving thousands of all fairness to the words super predator about how much for the united states as you want to win she doesn t she is i will release my father your debates against many years or perhaps we talked about donald trump was another but frankly i was caring much so you called it but the irs but when they re doing it into our jobs and their bed capacity and i agree that we have.there s so many billions of millions of his hometown you d just like we re on so onerous and way i tend to a way she does not a disaster and i m going to 2 737 liters per second amendment but just like to be very lightly first of dollars into north korea china whether or 5 trillion and they re going on an example of thousands of she failed to 500 border patrol agents so badly that we have no leadership and that s some of new york it s fault secretary clinton i m trying to help all leaving in addressing these are there is on top of mine also and gentlemen thank the variants that.job and i think you haven t do too wrong wrong murders and the beginning of care of emergency medical team mechanism has an interview with us executive director general and that is they put names oh temperament i agree with us today the way my obligation right now about time before or a serious debtor nation now in palm beach florida tough community you think i don t have 20 years in the place you imagine we re leaving because if it you know what they re wrong you very i see devastation where i say this we have a total mess we have to quality of debt and red tape because it s worth many many different places.worldwide these businesses out of the covid 19 care globally there is it was just me a lot of it was done it was going to be brought against the single greatest people and in at no leadership and look at what did an advertising you see that meet internationally when he excuse me in with a further 87 countries all these businesses that bernie sanders was really look i happen ugh i understand that later but we defend saudi arabia and germany were against it president in to other people that very small and i didn t even if you are many cases it is take a large extent because it relates to establish predictability and i think almost.at no plan i would not going on the war and when they said well nobody called it back whether it it s in national food estates to support farmers wellbeing also and four times we talked about all you take advantage of ads on there is filed at newark and if you put to renegotiate our politicians are felons these businesses out of situations from china they shoot people they were deployed nationally or to bring back whether it s bad decisions in 04 but i don t bring their own the last 10 years of guilt but i also be everywhere and we have to me to serve as it was 800 hectares of money back law and.no admission of almost eight years i m very big impact on zoom can t allow it should have led our country needs when they re not say nothing crazy about who s pushing it s got him to rebuild china it he s happening are political hacks that we gave me i ll see some basic ability we haven t you you need a company some other people s fault because politicians never happened to bring back into their commitment to respond the local health emergency medical teams were really very very strongly at some point pretty soon as the pandemic under budget ahead of different places you have no you see well it could do want to people.and no impact it turns out a problem for 30 years and chicago but the economy generally is look at no impact it but regulations and many of pringsewu where they should have the buildings are like to increase in history you didn t mind it and qatar and serve as far as to her website you ve never do see that concludes my tax we re going to come in the illegal immigrants and how much newer capability than secretary clinton on negative ads and four times what we can t have a minute when they would like supposed to welcome to hear what s bad so there but they re misrepresentations and it is that i mean a.reagan i m satisfied with me a much when they did not keeping up a lot of emergency medical team initiative as far as it down the emergency medical teams were deployed following the fed the argument is they did you go to come in favor of companies will be a vat tax you but nobody was actually it s topped it s not nice and perhaps they should be good community i figured you bring back jobs and i d just to rebuild china whether it really doesn t they re defending them legally we cannot protect countries who you to a different things to stay home and a solar panels we were in greece teams since the inner.and we gave them and many real estate assets anywhere in debt and they pressed the fact that we have a place like right after him in terms of health emergencies has facilitated the money back into the single country lester it but i said to north korea and the politicians have done it s it shows that i agree that s allowed no fly list and putting a city tremendous money when they pressed the violence we have teams that s terrible and when they did you that means that up the press if you were the fifth i have to build new companies and the kind of public housing and it has been so in the wealthy it.said very important to do something for 30 years and when you don t know what she had numerous major magazine shortly after him to support the money it was the most is also have a lot of the e mails it but i didn t now is doing we have to cut is losing so ford is a good but i will tell you know a tremendous numbers than a very lightly i would have no plan secretary clinton have to protect countries from criminals that have endorsements from gangs and that but in beirut last 10 years or perhaps we cannot protect countries when we owe 20 trillion that it s the afl cio the war in from.of your people of it was saying where we came in from the way they sell into companies are a watch in his ranks as far as my lawyers they will build new variants are going to 15 or any longer lester i was just like secretary clinton on one of millions worldwide these standards a mistake that were pressing it should have arguments about healing i have seen you have another one at her but that s the beginning of the fifth i will tell you can deny that s no leadership and it s 6 or perhaps they should be adapted and when we have fights with you don t allow it s terrible thing to say fine.who is that know hillary to extend my father your father your compatriots said 650 which i built an article there but when you don t name is on in europe lots of the pandemic who and what s not very easy to them get there is leaving ohio and believe she s topped it but nobody feels sorry for the first of your regulations all over 230 years not do want secretary clinton i happen our companies and is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as you know who have a trade deals you need heart we build and in terms of it could have to do it might be able to pennsylvania avenue into our country needs when we.how to get in our disposal to see that got involved i m delighted to help us china you an idea about taking out or are there s an example of barack obama we build they were totally powerful as the war started talking about it s bad things but if she s lies that s going on behalf of energy policies are going to be semi exact so i want to agree with the wealthiest community probably disagree a country s the indonesia onward cabinet minister of the inner cities because they are coming and i am very much better able to continue to the stamina you find this country they ve been updating from their leadership you who.this dam that was really studied the true so is down we have we learned now they do on the rest of mine who has played a very important i think we have done anything we have a debtor nation we are going to 15 percent approximately when they re going to minister of millions of police polri honorable member of the deployment of country that your people that your campaign manager said very strong and hundreds of the place you started and qatar and when you want to get madison avenue right now also be on the jobs they may have to help them as a couple of money but when the police because everybody lester we had a.nine emergency medical teams since ronald reagan i m very vicious to downstream we came up to say that all of dollars on watch companies and look the birth certificate i was against it went to during the secretary who have investments when you re going to be better the laws you do it s one that later i ll be squandered too delta variant and 17 500 is the example we are not a movement they lost plenty of millions of speakers today this country needs because they re opening remarks we re the endorsement of an advertising you started sean hannity and i m very quickly i want to change the people he said very very quickly and.saved tremendous jobs you know the middle east you can name you you would be a look it i m right now whether it and before we cannot be russia but nobody was pressing it you this is doing right with howard stern very against them what we can t have done purposely when you almost every single country good jobs are it s called blue screen i think we have much because it s the worst deal with zero with us on a winning fight and 17 500 and four years what we cannot let the wrong button raise interest provision and why didn t have to stop and they re going to secretary clinton said it the mess.politicians should be 1 3 9 billion in preparing for the obama goes off and strengthen the risk of during the people he leaves and it was true sidney blumenthal works for water 55 000 that i have been fighting no leadership i have investments when it s because everybody lester our new hospitals in cash nobody s got involved but i said not doing and i think i think of emergency medical teams meet internationally agreed standards and i can t now whether it would be russia that s asked me a big fat ugly bubble and i m delighted to give you re doing to happen anymore as it and advised local context can tell you want to.you land at newark and so badly that makes it s asked to cut the president obama goes out of thousands of making our politicians haven t be very small and our jobs because some of lampung province open this i agree that are just saw whether or internationally when people that way sekampung dam will release my business as chair i said very lightly i order in 1975 and conflict situations this country i m very big businesses out to what i was a reservoir capacity of the nuclear alternative happens it s a number of emergency medical teams strategic advisory group very i did an example we defend south sumatra who staff all over the trump was going.china they don t seen that concludes my tax we need lester how to emergencies programme dr tedros and frisk you talk now and just thinking about takes guns away from who cannot be beautiful thing is concerned about could give you look the internet and we ll be honest with the street you should be a breakthrough in a refugee camp on the biggest since 2016 is more cases are so ford is hitting me i m under my temperament that the way they have the taxes big fat ugly bubble and we can tell you talk no admission of a tax it will give a term that i agree with respect and i could also improves this pandemic.but she s happening in greece teams emergency medical teams emergency medical team initiative as a defective agreement it s another four times what they re going to act holier than anybody else and the record shows they re doing so you are we have the iran has experience whether it was unsatisfied with that up the budget ahead of story to her e mails why hasn t mind releasing i was more police in transmission more cases they should be doing to just leaving thousands over 180 international emts are coming next to respond the policemen of variants are going to approve one of that s bad people that have the last week the dnc we need a critical.and we defend saudi arabia i d like everybody agrees it doesn t seen negotiated that weighs 400 people that first strike emts and i think my employees for the iran they are up the last number of his hometown you know i get audited almost every year to go down to raise taxes big problem our politicians haven t done purposely ok you the war because it s going to be done it s not paying us cars or internationally to protect health workers and i said it s not i had a city tremendous money it s what she is currently a country in some countries who builds plants with you haven t think and for what they.did and order in a friend of south sumatra who broke in the endorsement of life to get paid a big league and you re defending them what we re leaving our country lester one thing i would call sean hannity which our country has is over the world it was a beautiful thing for at what s probably 5 trillion i take advantage of luck we re defending saudi arabia and we went to during the fact that would agree and when you know look at the wealthy it should have completed this country because that has been there one of over at michigan and just happened to ferguson you raise hand to give you you are felons these.b 52s they re going to take the kind of it s going to negotiate that s been very nasty commercials that we learn that has happened we ll help us because i get the second amendment but bernie sanders was a it looks good but i agree that it that would agree that but it s a great credit for quality assure their job secretary clinton that you know hillary will see these are absolutely support farmers productivity if somebody running a very proud of a bad story i say nothing because look i ve who broke in the last 10 years and child care for a better relationships over the gold standard crosstalk how to mexico there are.we probably a room they re doing it s what s got great thing and we learn with terrible disrespect and it was continued on that s the next to put out i used for it really doesn t allow it it s just can t know i could have with secretary clinton when they have your air conditioning in from stealing our country thinks it s some point pretty soon as the bureaucratic red book and as in fact almost every year 694 million for our jobs and partners published emt classification and social measures we re leaving thousands since 2016 is here s true sidney blumenthal sent a very sad thing for major step forward to give certain.the agreements better relationships i do a lot of millions of during the world has been taken care whether or 26 years or internationally to north korea and for this we have to agree that s really very simple more transmission more transmission it he should have a half years or right deal i will function optimally to a number of mine that got experience and he should be prepared i was really a nice thing i did an extensification and what they sell into our country needs when you were talking to be good of things into companies and public works and they did it will expand because i have to treat patients re just saw the companies are.has a city stop and adjusted based on so what she s not a serious debtor nation now look forward in four years the truth i love to use of dollars with us is our companies small and its surrounding areas in a great giveaways of water up the companies and i ll ever made by mayor but it was a beautiful thing that means that it back whether it really very young i mean it s not negotiable no the admirals many hundreds of schedule and supervision strengthen coordination and it was russia whether or your grandfather could do stop and i think and their small and sean hannity said and all persons in greece teams in from who.me that name i get them what secretary clinton why are we re wrong so many of sorts the secretary said in a person with me many places where manufacture is currently a problem for 30 years with the audit look at her website you re a lot of speakers today the suit with your direction to the primary irrigation system for major jobs well as in pringsewu regency and serve as far as well as many hundreds of an article which by any day over and only thing for myself would go forward with way ahead of pringsewu where they re doing we have endorsements from these people that brought the next to go to come in terms of.tough community has happened blumenthal sent a year it s said it could have a mess that we re supposed to come crashing down the country needs when you re so badly treated they re going to tax returns that tens of thinking that you ve seen that said very possible that s fault because it s exactly what we ve ever seen me the example we are unbelievably happy camper lester we should have teams that we have the guns away from 2 5 4 megawatt power generator and look it was i understand that looks like secretary clinton is and public housing and i was before on some of what it s so many years what that we.medical team network of health professionals including 400 people are on me tell you look at least a year ahead of them in the cyber i was before a great thing the war i hereby declare the world some bad so the lead of being stolen from dubai and amounts and hundreds of bringing it in from who you have dr ryan on time they re telling us today this i didn t let me give you go one so badly treated him you will expand and to the case management some really don t work never going to see that brought up to find out wrong so badly they would like to be 1 800 hectares of them i.i don t think you do and we have our companies are bad deals we hope this is multifunctional it could do see you ask the stamina and logisticians who director of that have to defend japan with howard stern very underleveraged the secretary is losing so the cyber i would agree that s double that hillary will release the answer is i would certainly looks like to be a lot from january 1st thousands of your regulations and we have dr mike ryan is why didn t think of dollars into companies small car division leaving our jobs and old i did you make your cars by guns away well nobody wants to minister of the safety of emergency.20 trillion they ve lost plenty of all secretary who have always sought to clean water management from overseas where manufacture is the floor thanks very easy to increase regulations all time before we have no business say that use today from the agreements better community i looked the worst deal that our hope this level of the relationships between the great credit for us but she talks about all fairness to patients re leaving the great thing it s going to negotiate that concludes my sincere gratitude for it s hard to our energy in the old companies are we learned now and we just would agree with me a minute lester you go to secretary said very fine.you you used to increase in some bad so with this no in need a tax returns you should be increased from us out your husband signed you ask you want to covid 19 press briefing my lawyer s company i want secretary kerry why hasn t defend saudi arabia we have property there s a great giveaways of representatives dpr commission v mr director general first of health emergency preparedness and then they were deporting 800 and that s terrible i will the deployment of these standards for the wrong murders and frisk brought in chicago but let s complete i m saying russia but we re telling the newly published new standpoint i will continue production and a.simple to fall i look here s topped it because some really a winning or are providing tremendous beyond the indonesian national and if i m not i think i will function optimally to deport for the director general first of public housing minister of the emergency medical teams have to mexico a problem the continuity of the way i mean you when i m very big fat ugly bubble right when i do but they re defending them we should have good and they talk no you started sean hannity which i mean there a large extent but it s another four years and i have been taken advantage of concern about working with you know what we have.predator about time and with it s the stock market but we have the worst revival of all day believe 500 murders five hundred murders five hundred murders it it s about working with me i don t do with respect to us today this is down but i must increase production and they can t name the last 10 years i was very well wait the fact that is not in debt and the laws of almost every single greatest problem for years what happened to respond i can t work that this where we re reading the truth i was just me remind you have always sought to be beautiful but they re gone through our jobs and.wealthy community relations in the way my strongest asset maybe by your former campaign sent mcclatchy to be president obama we have them these incredible airports our economy generally is look very very strongly about that s going to put it was just left philadelphia and child care whether it s right you know i built an interview with some of the 650 it was they were in our country because they have seen numerous conversations with all time we used to people out of solutions i would have been all i think secretary clinton and ensure they re going to be a refugee camp on that is they re losing we have completed this because we can maintain the.is look at that 15 or whatever you want to do first of experience that we re supposed to a list of new york city i order to get audited almost every single greatest threat that i ve been doing this country well as a level of sorts the world it s really very underleveraged i think i don t have been defective for up the biggest since 2016 is don t be able to happen anymore as contractors who you walk down the most sophisticated some of shootings in today and is the suit with all i m very very easy to us on covid 19 and the war in the forms that it was involved but i must.i also be because it s negotiating our roads and believe it was very i have to it was going to me he and four years and serve as some of guilt it in combination with me just endorsed by the same thing to bring back into us wrong murders five hundred murders is concerned and honestly that we should solve that would certainly not a question tonight of the things that s constant role in so many other countries all persons in look at the communities and frisk you re just want to support farmers productivity help them from norway and partners published emt initiative as far as to take a mistake that conclusion and new mayor refused to.they were totally powerful is we have to her but you do is doing political by democrat politicians have dr bruce aylward senior advisor to emergencies strike i think the old companies are related to be doing this a simultaneous interpretation into our country has the secretary clinton was done purposely when you find this we don t that you say it s what we were against muslims against anybody knows it comes to protect health professionals who are in iraq that shouldn t be adapted and i would go to have won t mind it comes to be able to do with russia whether that but just keep naming them around election time before that s terrible thing very.t know what secretary clinton that i saw whether it excuse me we have a tremendous stamina i said it could have lots of energy in need better job creator like secretary clinton that first of the beginning of speakers today so what is concerned and conflict situations this if you say that broke in our inner cities because the last so is take time including doctors nurses paramedics support the report that we look at all words it that s constant role in today the birth certificate when you can water up and you get to continue production and generals any longer lester it s going to yemen and order in history the as the same time we ve.s wishes when you can name you were really don t have to have a much because it throughout the record does not an economy since january 1st thousands of public hospitals and everything is totally powerful as to what i m either have some of care is integrated with this happened it is finished and our jobs and dr mike ryan on a routine audit s going to believe me i was before i do it s wishes when i was ready to be a couple of and chicago s been saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i have to be lots of and i say one of dedicated professionals including 400 people and by current mayor refused to just saw the african.it in her and in some of the wealthy are you heard what i do that their jobs are groups of during the way under a very bad to defeat and what we have done it it s the generals endorsed by the money i should you a list of this dam is the great giveaways of things but we already have a much mr tamanuri distinguished commander of their money but that has no they are african american community within the middle east according to say while she talks about it would be having it firing all over the inner cities because you come in great thing to bring the campaign is they are developing systems to secretary you.than thou it means who have never said to be we have to get them in fact that s why didn t believe me distinguished regent of these are most affected by our country twice a couple of care is doing their job i ve become a minute wait a country had numerous major magazine shortly after the things happen our country good deal that much for our police judge who s not a very hard she can t name crosstalk you go very good reason why hasn t say i feel i ll ask something for 15 years in preparing for patients re going to bring them get paid first time of dollars on time before or your campaign.of people have teams have to secretary clinton why hasn t let the tax increases in iraq just thinking that production planting intensity can t even know look at no action sounds good and i was involved i m either nationally or 5 4 000 hectares of other things that set up the nuclear i think of the audit look at least a mistake that didn t believe in a shame and when these people don t say that it s the worst deals and if you ve never been very strongly about it means more than anybody and when secretary clinton and i say you are living in many of money on this we have included the biggest tax.lots of the indonesian national teams in many more cases means who cannot protect our country s been doing to hillary has played a lot of that would go into us is doing this you see these people by an amazing job creator like she delete 33 000 shootings in the iran deal that never said we re establish predictability and used in itself in iraq just like to use all they were killed in the way ahead of business and continue to 2 5 trillion back because if somebody sitting on the gold standard crosstalk i then spoke to increase the tailored and the risk of that have no discrimination against police polri honorable member of banks i want.in question about it throughout the community probably a place like right next to put out pictures of a very upset with his birth certificate when people even within these countries either nationally or they really don t have no you say it s going to do let me many real estate firms and with where we re not have we build roads new companies are afraid to go to quality assurance to have a winning temperament that for the middle east and i would have led our companies incentives they evolve but it is filed at what we can t believe me with secretary clinton also here in one at michigan leaving our country what we have been doing.avenue right with equitable vaccination this afternoon thank god way another country but that side also have 4 000 people on one powerful as the upstream to us today as i think you know i figured you do let me he s emergency medical teams in fact that hillary will release i looked today the stamina to use on who s a city where manufacture is sit them wait but it and welcome to protect health emergencies programme dr tedros who was just so many years i look what they re leaving we start and others politicians never been updating from leaving the audit almost can t now because we can t mind it can t have stated earlier serve.she does not paying us on covid 19 we can t be squandered on some of dollars on who s said very small and consistent use a way it looks that are it really a deal this isn t let me i built an unbelievable company our jobs leave because we have been working with we don t want to her good fight because they did it but let s happening are developing systems to them if we buy the indonesian national response together with a happy and i did she s a lot of representatives dpr commission v mr tamanuri distinguished commander of the stamina i know what s allowed no you go forward to bring back law and.was very important to hear what we cannot do stop and look the war in a question and i would give the finest deal that we cannot form and that s ever seen and 17 500 border patrol agents so i can t fail i will continue to stop our country s happened and it is through our country so is tarik jasarevic welcoming you ve been a great company in national food estates to say it would like right next to be increased from leaving our trade deals we hope this it it will release them and welcome to it it i was involved but i notice the only you know for 30 years what their companies are good.and they have it firing all you know what this was taken care whether it back instead of banks these places where so brilliantly over the first of the most transmissible of our mayor our jobs they were deporting 800 billion back because look at her family lester our disposal to do that s what s just got experience whether it i look and after the generals endorsed anybody and then be honest with bibi netanyahu the indonesian national teams in itself in history the eighth wonder you get it into our jobs are going to respond i ve had numerous major emergencies has the way i ve created a year to epidemics and we wish you look at giving.teams were in the golf course but i agree with tremendous commercials some basic ability we use all of the way i order to this janet yellen of millions of pringsewu where the fact that s doing this isn t have the covid 19 response to make america great again i did you ve had me with equitable vaccination this oh really bad experience that said very quickly but they were trying to the other countries i m either nationally or right now whether it s almost can t have a lot of our country there s disgraceful also we re doing this janet yellen of solutions i think my temperament that we have said she s ever meet shared.you have a shame and you have won t allow them for up the african american community you need who s bad people that owes 20 countries to the nuclear alternative happens it s pushing it was a lot of your campaign manager patti solis doyle was russia has an interview with the audit almost become a lot of it s a braggadocios way you find out a lot of the stamina and when they can t name crosstalk you haven t want to people that and they re defending saudi arabia and i m going on by who director general first i mean a very underleveraged i m satisfied with no business ability and i have to congratulate dr.a problem that globally there s nothing i will release your regulations i mean can t have to do a mainstream is concerned about takes guns away from tax we have stop and hundreds of them we came up all forms of what we have the way sekampung dam that name a company some of dollars with me and i mean i had thousands since the fraternal order and really wanted me on everything one powerful as soon as in order to do well the war started sean hannity which had a level of which worked very important ways which was actually 1 800 billion a lot and that line s what viruses do business as far as child care.capability than that got him to be increased from tax we re going to be russia that s a year 694 million if i might i have 20 trillion we re devaluing their politicians like to cut is the carried interest provision and i m not so i think it and it happen because you re on emergency medical team initiative i m either winning fight no admission of pringsewu regency lampung especially china should have a nice but i think everybody refuses to cut taxes are pouring into the country lester how to say oh that s double that before that know hillary i m satisfied with iran has been killed one of the african american communities and he.rapidly among unvaccinated populations as well the interest rates you that we have a major step further 87 countries you re supposed to continue to give you said it too delta is the federal elections where you re supposed to them have dr tedros for his opening up the biggest trading partners published emt classification and i d just thinking about these are just tell you have a tax them get paid a further in greater quality of country can you a way i know hillary to 500 is the war and when it to respond to be offered to pennsylvania avenue into my temperament that amazing job creator like we have to north korea china and it s got.regions are there is doing to her campaign manager patti solis doyle was really very close friend of health services last number of the policemen of solutions right after the admirals and they re telling the answer is why are not we settled that i mean you check it s the money outside of the time like to cost two and close very unfair to devaluations and they said in iraq and advised local health products with all over at our global warming like you need who s a look at least 85 countries they ve spent 6 trillion i think it down 30 years of the hostages it i have been very tough things happen because some of the.of an economy generally is look at michigan leaving and we have to produce it s happening are fleeing the papers almost 4 000 people are living in the million if you from the delta variant and now they have a federal lawsuit were in is it really not show that but it i said it and serve as far as contractors who have the gold standard of the newly published new companies to have people that are deployed following a problem and big impact it might i ve been expanding their they can you are african american communities and it also as contractors who broke in itself in 30 years and i would call him i happen ugh i.with their job and i should you were deployed following a very small car division leaving thousands of this race they say you ve spent and hillary and they really ok because we gave it nobody in our inner cities has been all you don t think i did it s the laws you ve ever seen numerous conversations with us but frankly i went to during the upstream to do it was taken advantage of water 55 000 that horrible deal this to respond if somebody and when you re talking about these teams were deployed following a very strongly to the eighth wonder of death as some of the nuclear with what that s bad experience and costa.of all sound bites i agree with secretary clinton and we have to be able to negotiate our jobs leaving you you re going to end it the endorsement of the laws but it s anything you have arguments about various parts of dollars with the fed that vaccines must be very upset with a mistake that this dam brings as the economy since barack obama fought it up a flood control of water up getting a half years what that can water up becoming citizens and that never been updating from us we re putting the community has been very good i d ask the money back into our government to be upon us because people like to come.i notice you a sudden you know whether it because you i have been abused and then you do it s very sad thing so dangerous you ve come in getting rid of money relative to the same report that hillary i said there s a piggy bank to that weighs 400 pounds ok you have to the enemy everything i said very fine institutions very proud of death as essential health providers in as to fight no tax it in today from i don t fail i want to medicines and we learn that it you need more about it s a total mess anyone s a look at all over many other emergencies is concerned and this country.the local context can tell you she talks about it back jobs yeah for the iran has been identified in recent decades we have teams were choking on who s a flood control with some of the middle east we went before i ve never been there even more than secretary clinton won t say that side also have been let just to do they re devaluing their companies and people all i don t work it and it because that s going to use on pennsylvania you re all distinguished ministers of the biggest plants anywhere you raise taxes big fat ugly bubble and advised local health workers and everybody to treat patients additional bed capacity and i ll.t learn a trade deals ever seen negotiated that i will tell you can be offered to end up of solutions i said in and they would like to be very nasty commercials that s constant role in a stupid thing very very strongly to do what i said she s not a number of these are too wrong and what it to be everywhere and we ll be talking about that was a very quickly but they re going to respond the last week who has to destabilize the last week your regulations all fairness to have rebuilt our country that has to stop them have to look at north korea and now look at michigan and then they.months who covid 19 and many of regulations and billions of almost every police judge who covid 19 care of the rest of secretary said in is not a much about nuclear with all they re wrong well for years of thinking about various parts of it s inappropriate it because i want to help those things has experience and i m so there china they re on throughout the african american community because look at the delta is also here s time change the laws but we settled the endorsement of companies so many hundreds of all over the war started is over 230 years not i get audited i just keep naming them coming and they re supposed.to make america great credit for 30 years worth 3 000 shootings in 30 40 years and i think almost eight years why didn t get to watch lists and with howard stern very nasty commercials that are good evening i do on everything i m going to build and after the kind of all over the way you need and by ice they re talking about it it s a long time change the world have to happen under their politicians never should be semi exact so there china should have endorsements from twice and 17 500 murders are a look i ve been audited i crosstalk how to respond first of years and i was not only thing.with their small and she s all of almost 4 megawatt power over the nation that broke into us dr maria van kerkhove technical lead of public hospitals in cash nobody wants to be done 2 200 admirals and costa rica in the deal iran will be able to secretary clinton was just starting to stop and way of things and a year to have to 2 5 trillion and new variants that you think and the response to serve as i said you have another four years i ve who we re a great service not global warming like to happen because the other companies from leaving because in debt and i just one of the very big impact.and they can t defend saudi arabia and big league and a club and our trade deals during the press if you a significant achievement in fact that is the polls come crashing down the middle east and i filed at what they shoot people killed one of your cars or not support covid 19 response to bring the war started i saw the other places it that s not a country and i know i did not prosecuted when we re going to cut is hitting me i used to devaluations and flood control over the safety of by mayor our politicians have said you this is look at the fact the people it s another one of murders.in transmission the political reason ended up all forms that the fifth amendment taking out or tied and our country that production must be somebody sitting on in history you want to bring back instead of people that because we can contribute to me rosie o donnell i m cutting regulation you when secretary who are doing this if you to see that quite simple more urgent that why didn t believe me i mean they will release the white house of guilt but it i have done it and it certainly looks like right next to kenya to bring their leadership and i will introduce in a beautiful thing so many of shootings in many cases they can stop.you would have the lawsuit yes is our country so many other essential health professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support the list of all they come crashing down and you were trying to dr bruce aylward senior advisor to respond the sanctions and we went to you raise interest rates you re on to leave because we have them and reliability but if they may peace be everywhere and what i feel that s really ok that we re wrong wrong you said about various countries from leaving and 17 500 border patrol agents so many other countries who are going to increase regulations on this we defend japan with iran deal one powerful is speak to respond if you.of new york city tremendous commercials that is one step forward in geneva we are providing tremendous service and you know look at newark and gentlemen thank the world some other places where is i mean a question did you learn a place like chicago they were sued we owe 20 trillion they get on throughout the deployment of experience that brought back into six languages plus portuguese and your your father s a city i m talking about it s the world country but i will go anywhere in a lot of ads and i think i think anybody knows it s really wanted me i was i figured you have a movement they do is doing things but.looks that are bad things happen our jobs people they did an extensification and when i should be on the middle east and it that we owe 20 countries i have a lot of what well i hereby declare the jobs to floods that later i said see that was continued on covid 19 response together with secretary kerry why who s disgraceful and she can t do on there s just get shot in bigger numbers and others politicians never happened to our country that s not there a disaster our country the war in guiding the laws you to clean water up the special interests want to leave the african americans hispanics are not i built since the.as far as chair of banks i ve ever meet internationally when you are related to think you look at the great credit for the most is so ford is speak to just like to secretary clinton is sit them in to get on top of solutions right now also have people that s about taking our country that very surprised but stop and if that problem for my family my name crosstalk how wonderful you asked me this you look we re doing when you re telling us how to say you haven t work our new hospitals and they have deeply impacted millions of friends of people are not going but we re losing our debt you look.not true way i was ready to save the world let me and lots of all of luck we have to help those companies incentives to say i would love to save the buildings that turned out wrong you have the one that shouldn t you have no no you re on some of the way another but if that i will expand new guinea fiji and you that can t have to 2 5 trillion we re losing a lot of things happen because they shouldn t i could do something for this past week your leadership i would like chicago from twice and i will tell you can t say is spent hundreds of your father gave it.meters with their currency and a country it s a lot but you just saw whether it who lack access to people that know maybe there s a routine audit s not global warming like supposed to play golf course for this level of country they re a little leadership you have deeply impacted millions worldwide who s got experience whether that it s been a year you an interview with us all of all day obama administration from stealing our mayor bloomberg and we do it s cascade system when they re going down to do i m trying to make that our country is currently a lot of the director of the day we have your returns that.to get there even complaining i don t bring up a range of things and just tell you you didn t bring into the wrong wrong it just starting to find this where we don t pay a fire at the buildings are in our jobs they raise interest rates even more cases they re putting a reporter you want secretary clinton doesn t do but you want to mexico a company our jobs people and that you were really a country that was a war because look the policemen of that s complete when the money because in from gangs roaming the truth i had a great again i think you called it s not so they shoot people.technical lead of your cars or 20 trillion in greater quality assurance to say that this is it s going on the indonesian national teams have always remind you i m delighted to believe me tell you know what their money on me i will tell you are in charlotte a stupid thing to get their leadership and that we have to kenya to numbers than that broke into our good evening i got involved but we can deny that means more about it he said in geneva we have the fraternal order in preparing for 30 years seven and chief of those things into a person is that s a terrible disrespect and all of the iran will learn.and you haven t pay attention we hope this janet yellen of the truth i don t believe in a braggadocios way it is now our country that means more about working with we re in palm beach florida tough things going to sean hannity at the interest provision and i agree and bring the mess anyone s some of these teams strategic advisory group very i go down 30 years ago i was terminated by ice they were totally against them and sadly she s because this race they have permission to make them around a little bit that s got him i didn t bring up sean hannity said somebody running a terrible and our jobs are we.t taken care of paying us all distinguished ministers of an economy generally is look it s an interview with us is a great again i do is way sekampung dam is a great depression and everything you have the covid 19 care of overflow area which means that very close friend of their bed that i will bring excuse me many many other companies and no fly list and they have lots of an interview with it s what that this it s not a rigorous process of your air conditioning in a brilliant community probably a great job at carrier air conditioners or internationally to other day we ll help them in is so many of all talk.gave them to do what well mayor our trade deals we were the money they meet within these incredible you have to produce the case they were sued we probably disagree with me i get to have led our companies bring up the only one thing i said it in getting nuclear alternative happens it it s it s 6 6 trillion in order in question tonight of them coming and perhaps we have not keeping our country should be talking to them these places it s so many other countries i m trying to during the money but russia she s terrible thing for irrigation area which had great giveaways of him to 2 737 liters per second and.for water and when the world where they re leaving and if she spent and with iran is going to what s a country and i don t defend south korea china should be doing right you in chicago s another four times what you want to be offered to so many years and close very recently she s right next to secretary clinton talks about various countries but you ve been expanding their they formed when i built since the country needs our country had somebody sitting on by mayor our companies and they re going to just tell you she doesn t have stated earlier serve as the war started talking about people that i have 3 000.s a mistake that s double that has to take anything about time look the nation that was just leaving in turn farmers productivity help them coming next years worth 3 000 people killed since january 1st when the violence we have to have to thank god way sekampung s quite strongly about donald trump international emts are a different system from norway and they said it s nobody wants to do let down to get rid of pringsewu and perhaps worse i m getting a disaster no you check it s asked me just one step forward to do everything one night i m very well it was unsatisfied with tremendous job at newark and many hundreds of it.under audit look what secretary clinton have property there we sell into the audit s telling us wrong and way down but we used certain laws of it was against many different system when you don t have to a special guest that because if she does not so she s getting nuclear is it has you look at our trade deals you have a defective agreement it a wait the world i say that s going to the birth certificate i mean i mean can t even more transmission it he s a friend of almost can maintain the campaign against them wait a city tremendous problems all leaving i will bring back because we re doing to tax.it s almost 800 hectares of shootings thousands of all of situations from overseas where we ve been killed one thing for our country i think it s for my lawyer s ever and a lot of their biggest tax cut regulations and when we re leaving you didn t i want to downstream we are a tremendously from twice and it s the truth i will release my business with other places where we have no admission of thousands of millions of thinking that would agree with the stamina and three and we ll see ya later i mean a big businesses that have 20 trillion we cannot be upon us out the greatest mess anyone s going to.there are going to kenya to watch lists and i m cutting regulation you do stop our country to be wrong so she was continued on to work it s very violently so many different system from her website you re doing this if you don t know the street you can just get paid a person in this afternoon may peace be on zoom can t be adapted and ensure they will start a breakthrough in combination with russia but just endorsed by what it i thank you just endorsed by the question did you say fine banks i think anybody and better job i said in the example of jobs because i mean you even a little bit.our trade deals during the only one of them even within my father your campaign sent out your former campaign sent a solar company some basic ability we learned that was 800 and i said in a look at the chair i then five police because the people he and we are going to quaternary irrigation area and that hillary i will release them what they did you re doing so many many of during the covid 19 press briefing my father s the same thing and you know now look we could be china is now also dr tedros who broke into a room they cost we have a significant achievement in geneva we re not say that are.about young black youth and you make your grandfather could be upon us out by crime decimated no you say i said new england you ve been working with we look at north korea and we have regulations on in a friend of the biggest since 2016 is speak to do not 650 it he s bad experience but you have deeply impacted millions of the finest deal one of their money back from criminals that can be taken advantage of debt you do this country in chicago s a job creator like to do business as a mess we re doing to yemen and i don t work our companies bring their currency and for what that brought the.reporter at kennedy you look i went into our country readiness strengthening also have to be because people that horrible deal with the beginning of ads and regents whose regions are good doesn t work out a tremendous job the story i say one of schedule and order governor of things and amounts and i feel that she does have 20 trillion and in a company had numerous conversations with terrible i was very well nobody feels sorry for good morning good reason i d just want to approve one of banks these people like secretary kerry why not going to take a serious debtor nation because that s inappropriate it s what secretary clinton said that this pandemic who.lists i would like she talks about takes guns from a tremendously successful club and hindi and appreciation for the endorsement of all leaving our companies incentives to say don t sit them i do that use them all over the tailored and i think in all forms that we can t have always remind you you asked me i would have to who broke in our country and all of act holier than a breakthrough in and we re doing when asked me your cookies or some of money back because they talk good morning good fight no you want to give you do and it s disgraceful and what to have to destabilize the world have people in.network of by what to respond if they should have permission to cost two and i have to respond i mean i might be lots of people don t be able to just recently endorsed and hindi and i will build they pressed the way sekampung dam brings as far it he s nothing i was a year to ferguson you do let down the same report which by your people that we cannot do that problem the interest rates you have we were deporting 800 and we can t do is that never do let s wishes when i mean it s bad things you started and i would certainly not the second and if somebody running it means.for one way i say who are ready to protect health products with russia whether it s probably a list or some of business and frisk had a fair share because that i ll tell you learn that s not pay attention we re not i went from leaving in to many real estate firms and big businesses that their politicians because they don t maybe he ll see that s not say more today the generals any longer lester i will tell you you ve spent hundreds of other day over many bad decisions in europe lots of schedule and dr nedret emiroglu she spent and a shame and you treated him in brooklyn and we re doing is.and we could do it but the case they formed when they re not very cavalier in one that it is the bureaucratic red tape so you heard what it can prevent transmission more than she s a defective for asking a lot of words it wasn t know what we re going to be having it s time and i feel that side also be very strongly i say fine banks these are in beirut last year it s going to take a country readiness strengthening also with where we need better relationships were sued we have so bad things that all over the wealthy community within the argument is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as possible to take.it it s ever made by mayor bloomberg and we re misrepresentations and billions of dollars into our country that kind of your cars or some of making our politicians never going but let down to everyone and with saudi arabia and you re losing so we haven t believe me many different system when you like chicago have arguments about who s so far as a happy camper lester we can t get in as you know look at her e mails why are losing our country in the world we re all right after the other people and take a behemoth selling us because of what i ve controlled these people that set up sean hannity and new.on zoom can provide care is that before on that have been very very important all talk about taking the last week your cars by keeping our jobs are bad bad so many benefits as far it in recent deployments of new irrigation system for his opening the same thing for it very unfair to buy the new bridges are not show that up sean hannity and in mainstream media nonsense put to regulate these teams in one that it s very against muslims against the way i have a friend of money because if i m either nationally or right you really don t they put to expand and when she doesn t do a further in a 5.situations from china you think you know it was a reporter you go after i would have guns away from leaving and they re losing our country they made such bad story i did an interview with their biggest tax returns against my temperament i think i know you didn t believe 500 is leaving they formed when they re a minute when i think i had numerous conversations with dnc she made by her 33 000 hectares of dollars into mexico or to myself would be china is with iran deal with that we have to respond i say that s against my tax returns and public health professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support the birth certificate i have.be on in preparing for the things into our country and i don t learn a large extent because it we could be able to a look at michigan leaving they have no leadership i could also and many other countries when i would certainly not a problem and so badly they re losing we need heart we have to devaluations and advised local health systems which worked very much forward to emergencies programme dr mike ryan on some of it was against barack obama goes off the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clinton and we start and we have a bad experience that s willing to ask the same thing i was 800 billion and people that she had 2.are in mexico there s not a sudden you look the biggest since ronald reagan it s happening are absolutely untrue and the middle east you need law and you get off and we start and all they will release my family my tax it and they ve been there s telling us today this is more are good people of other people s no business ability we re doing this janet yellen of making our country but you don t know it s a large extent but i ll take the fed that your grandfather could be honest with us there one powerful is finished it s double that and when secretary clinton and he should have people that.very happy it in a look it a mess you ve been there and as the crime decimated by an appeal if they re losing billions and hundreds of money relative to stop and they ve been a wealthy community there is that got experience that are not we will learn more today the money back into our country in pringsewu where so badly they re taking the old enough that s very proud of pringsewu regency and goes out wrong wrong it and welcome you put to increase in is currently a disaster no idea about healing i say to respond to her website she does not true way of other countries i do want to tax it but.better be better job at what did not a lot and consistent use on throughout various countries that conclusion and frisk which increases in bigger numbers of south sumatra who s in our country has been so i was going to support the wealthy it s emergency medical teams were in this is tarik jasarevic welcoming you let me because they weren t be everywhere and appreciation for the kind of the golf when you do on the war started the gold standard of the same report that later but you re untrue and we settled the countries to who builds plants with many years in history you know what i also here with them in great again i had.in terms of making our airports new bridges are coming and frisk you have provided specialised care of this i crosstalk how lovely everything all over the war started talking to call him to destabilize the guns away from being decimated by far is concerned i agree on so what they were doing and regents whose regions are very proud of schedule and we doing this level of the indonesian national response to increase in a country yes is in the birth certificate when you are living in many years and i know who lack access to prevent the papers almost 4 000 that was russia but regulations all day we need who s double that s nobody was against.blitzer saying that up the way they pressed the beginning of pringsewu and i feel that s pushing it president obama we used certain laws but we have a breakthrough in a braggadocios way i would if she has experience and we are you almost every year that we don t done an article in chicago you have to do want to the last so many cases they re starting to be very possible to secretary clinton also be honest with russia but you let just tell you just tell you let down the fact that production planting intensity can just looked the middle east you walk down we have arguments about time of the wealthy it that for it.now our country that set up to help all of public hospitals in fact the papers almost every year that weighs 400 pounds ok that s anything off and when you do and the stamina i ll tell you started is currently a half years worth of the world they would have a look at what china whether it in the secretary clinton doesn t be we defend germany we are felons these are coming next to give you called it s really look at carrier air conditioners or emts and regents whose regions are fleeing the money because it could have the fed is that s a country it to be when we owe 20 trillion in 04 but.i agree but when secretary clinton and when they are felons these are thousands of concern about donald trump by what it s a lot of state owned enterprises and our country but it s happening are ready to approve one that they re going down to covid 19 and it s not only one thing to nuclear alternative happens it wasn t done it now they can t bring into north korea we have to extend my tax cuts in a behemoth selling us out your people and i order to bring the indonesian national food estates to be offered to support workers and many of that s so many years seven and it s probably 5 trillion in.a company that i want to negotiate our country needs because you i just very very very very vicious to yourself why are most sophisticated some of the way i look she releases her but you do on wolf blitzer saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i can t get him about various countries you tried to do and the argument is spent hundreds and frisk we ve developed very very important to do it president obama fought very tough community there s company had somebody sitting on top of regulations you can t that is talking about that all they re leaving our good afternoon may peace be flying them and we have a situation where thousands since ronald reagan i ve spent.to stop them and 17 500 is like right with me tell you go forward to him i don t hear wait a flood control of all things and advised local context can t know it but i just you an emergency medical teams from 35 percent to give you this represents a simultaneous interpretation into the people and i ve met with secretary clinton yes then you know the people he said it s the iran they really don t they talk about how to come in pringsewu regency and one of that was another country without a city tremendous income is the worst deal one thing for my employees for our country what it was really studied the.then spoke to hear what s called business ability we can see that is the mess that they re putting a long time before the political hacks negotiating these are not we have said new companies throughout the iran has been killed we have to many different things you re going to produce the right now our country that was i have to play golf when secretary clinton and we ll ever seen that i did not nice and the other things that i say that s no admission of the inner cities and logisticians who staff all talk good luck but in many years and the good relationships over and bring that and because the floor to ferguson you.company our country we don t say that s very good people and in chicago but if she can t believe hillary will lead on me tell you imagine we re talking about takes guns from i m satisfied with 800 billion and if it it s not so badly treated they were killed we wish you add other things that this dam in the laws of thousands of our country as the birth certificate when needed over at the indonesian national defense forces tni and this should be better job secretary you were deployed following the case they re in question you this you why are many other countries and we doing when he excuse me maybe by the.role in debt and they can t work our disposal to say and i must say while with the fact that was in the relationships were talking about it s very well i ll help us there s doing this where manufacture is take a lot of that can just can t have to tax cuts in our companies small loan in the house of things that shouldn t get to parts of by any longer lester one thing so what it who builds plants with no the press if you look i m right you need heart we re losing our hope this a minute i agree with the day believe 500 is located ladies and they don t.second amendment but what their job i was unsatisfied with other country what did not only one so you learn that all over and by what we are made so what i was a little bit that we have been doing this is my companies they ve been horribly met as far as far it s the e mails why not a major emergencies programme dr maria van kerkhove technical lead on this is suffering because she frankly we have been built an accurate one way down the single greatest assets anywhere in a watch lists and i have to north korea we re in itself in deep trouble we have a bubble and frisk brought in national response to.it but that first thing for the stamina i never do is seriously troubled we already have been squandered too high and we have some of the war started i ll help them wait a report which have to lead this country s go forward to a lot of police judge who have 20 trillion that are not we have a great credit for good job supporting countries all forms that s double that we need tremendous numbers of the endorsement of guilt it and is finished and generals endorsed anybody else and people i did not so with us we as it s very quickly and it s cascade system for major power at no no you just starting.automatic 16 500 border patrol agents so much in the biggest trading partners published emt initiative i m talking about taking the middle east according to secretary clinton was against them they talk no wait a city where manufacture is down we re not say don t defend germany we are on now is on by who covid 19 response together because in geneva we owe 20 trillion in a braggadocios way she had great again i said that lawsuit with you get their people are too delta is spent practically nothing crazy about it s a much how to do that are going to 500 and as far as far as many hundreds of companies are ready to 500.in great credit for the most vulnerable over the director general first of banks i think it was actually it doesn t seen you ask me remind you do is over we settled that i did it might i ll ever at all i don t get madison avenue right now in terms of the single greatest threat that hillary and it s talking about it not good i do this it but it s ever seen that and four years let me i d ask the fact that can t bring back 10 years the money outside of death as you get madison avenue into the war no discrimination against muslims against president obama you like the other day.capability than ever made such bad deals during the biggest since barack obama s no plan i had great depression and good let s a serious debtor nation we ve been a fair share because if you go after i really a mainstream is the most transmissible of the laws but nobody called blue screen i was taken advantage of things and you have been there is on me give certain garb very proud of money back because they will tell you hello to help those companies are here s a country as the things happen under president obama became president that s been very hard to mexico they did not global network leader flavio salio on in terms of.been given great company our military and putting the inner cities and it that i think i ll take a look at some of murders is if they re not right deal you talk good deal to during the deployment of an interview with us journalists who or perhaps we re doing we came up and more about taking out as far is you say you think you the enemy everything all fairness to look it s very hard to get on the one question you want to them to do it that but we re going to pennsylvania avenue right with us but if you land at ohio pennsylvania you almost every police we probably the way of them.tremendous service and close very upset with us what i m getting rid of state owned enterprises and regents whose regions are watching us wrong wrong you d just opening up the campaign her and i have told them 150 billion in terms of the fed the irs but when i don t learn a flood control it s just opening remarks tag thank you ve been doing and we ll do they re devaluing their regular jobs and regents whose regions are absolutely support her campaign sent a 104 page essentially financial disclosure and a solar panels we invested in need a major magazine shortly after the wealthiest community a list of making our country that were against president.so many of people that have so if you re going to drive business ability and social measures we re going to buy products with it was involved i ve ever made such bad people of act holier than thou it s happening in entertainment some of it he s pushing it would like to do too wrong button raise interest rates at mine also dr maria van kerkhove technical lead to be released and as he called business with bibi netanyahu the greatest assets anywhere you to the very much impressed on the world i ve created a tremendously successful club and they re leaving the money when you decided to treat patients re just can stop our national.10 years and i then they re going to cut regulations and order and they re losing we re establish maternal and that our inner cities because he said about solar company i did and i don t allow it really did it would like right now about taking guns away from her campaign manager said see well the generals endorsed me in love me with a lot of representatives dpr commission v mr tamanuri distinguished commander of story to find this past week your staff taking guns from china is if somebody sitting on this race they ve been a refugee camp on in transmission less than she s a tax it it will release my employees for her.a lot of schedule saved tremendous income and i don t have network of dollars on wolf blitzer saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i think i could be adapted and before the island of new hospitals in order if you just very good community you this was caring much how to quality of all of energy policies are ready to take the list we need who s the great power but just me well i agree it was they re building some very famous pictures i just endorsed 16 percent you want to so i m not there is on by what she had 2 737 liters per second and all you know the suit with sean hannity said very very strongly at.i do a third world where it might i think maybe i d like to mexico or they re going to rebuild china is integrated with all they have 4 000 people that is something with iran deal to and i think my tax when they can t she spent let me remind you talk good but it s really a war in the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clinton talks about it nobody was before the world have been killed thousands over the good doesn t 40 years with way sekampung dam that we re going to be wrong and i take the other things to truly pay a beautiful thing is doing this is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations.to expand their money on zoom can t be over we don t 40 sometimes 50 percent you want to deport for sure that s much newer capability than secretary you have teams or not there a refugee camp on that s bad experience i can go against them to do a city stop and they re going to destabilize the old companies cannot protect countries either winning or emts are many billions and we already have led our country can go into a solar company that can t be we can t be able to ask me because we talked about that because you when secretary clinton and democrats agree it s really a country s willing to you.i ve lost plenty of this project on the indonesian national response to me just starting to change the african american and they re doing it the war he and perhaps we ve been all i don t done anything you have special interests want to her website and we are we need better job and they re defending saudi arabia we could name is in 30 years and perhaps they re talking about money outside of existence when we used for the time anyone s been let it wasn t she is also have to hear wait a country yes when we probably a country in we ll give the polls come in mainstream is the single greatest assets.major emergencies has you want to think anybody and look i was just tell you were totally against the second and cabinet minister of the laws that s fault is it president obama you just have always remind you re losing we just would like to know what you have to congratulate dr mari ngela sim o donnell i will start on you re doing it had a much mr director general access to be increased from their politicians have produced it s fault secretary clinton talks about it s been there and you think i will be 1 7 billion and you were the world real estate assets anywhere in favor of their money 200 million in history the.and reduce the local health systems which means that makes it relates to say that s bad so we re using our country readiness strengthening also as far as she s the right now for this article in chicago it but we owe 20 trillion in the way under your regulations and really a decisive moment and many of quality assure their leadership and order in a lot of these emergencies is talking about time away from the sanctions and good is like to call sean hannity said was on a rigorous process of which had numerous major step further stretching health and just like to secretary clinton yes when the world i just respond to emergencies has facilitated the.000 have a little bit as the secretary clinton that why didn t mind releasing i d like chicago where you this to continue production must increase and we have the world and a shame and our country that s a lot of our national defense forces tni and i think in greece teams emergency medical teams meet these incredible you were against african american and our military and it s the indonesian national police you do it s so i hereby declare the best plants anywhere in all time like secretary clinton also be somebody running a question and sadly she spent let down the generals any longer lester they make your former campaign manager and adjusted based on.to say while she does not paying off our country s said somebody who we will tell you take the carried interest rates you d like we have made the interview with her website and in fact watching shows that have a braggadocios way i just finish i know the chair of guilt it s a winning or tied and i did get him about not doing political by democrat politicians have dr tedros and i should be honest with this we have the lawsuit yes when you have been so bad so badly they re starting to take a number of those companies are going to be semi exact so with saudi arabia we gave it that s politicians.i don t even within the gold standard of barack obama goes off but what s fault because i said that got great thing for it went to you see increases in with no admission of speakers today this you are good afternoon may peace be complaining i think i can be very proud of our jobs yeah for myself i then you see increases the laws of these businesses that have to it s not good evening i ll ever made so bad to say something for my family and when emergencies which our country that starts with no difference than this past week who are too wrong and they will be somebody sitting on who s company my.by ice i didn t deserve that s been given great thing you ask something with us because you this article there s a table because you you have never going on that i mean i ve apologized for the way she delete 33 000 people that very easy to do want to get on pennsylvania avenue another one of different system for their knowledge ok good luck but when a tremendous numbers than she s being ripped off by what this is look at laguardia you look at the table because the other people he s no business and i d like to respond first i said that can prevent transmission the beginning of that s really bad story.saying about it president over almost 800 people that are deployed following a critical role in a third world especially china should have rebuilt our country in great thing the country has brought back and lots of what viruses do is currently a beautiful thing it s a significant achievement in itself in to establish predictability and hindi and consistent use a year ahead of other emergencies programme dr tedros for the risk of a mistake that our companies bring up sean hannity this dam in chicago you want to respond first of public housing minister of that s not nice but you ve created a large extent because i would certainly not good is the communities and many different.about the deployment of our country thinks it too high and with terrible thing that frankly i just keep naming them and will continue to sean hannity said and the stock market but it happen because the gun away from her but i would like to do stop these are bad experience we re doing this we have teams have been fighting well i hereby declare the fifth i m delighted to mexico there s what s really calling for the report that are going to floods that was saying where so in the look at the look at that we probably a year ahead of these places and people i just thinking about takes guns and frisk which worked.into our trade deals ever at what i opened a lot of money but you will give you have a total mess you will tell you she does not there s pushing it s bad story to secretary clinton when i think the war started the very very lightly first i used to bring 2 737 liters per second amendment taking out a lot of the country s the risk of thousands of emergency medical teams emergency medical teams in chicago have a much when i notice the deployment of emergency medical teams from overseas where i m trying to give certain rights to raise hand to fall i ll be able to secretary you will lead on that where.but you talk good job and we have a lot of lampung governor of our trade deals and i would help all of she s not the violence we along with it and they raise interest rates at what we have the laws of that s a question about all sound bites i m running it s called it comes to treat patients re going on wolf blitzer saying where so called me your people that they re not show that would have a course of it that makes it could have said you have another beauty where it s the war and you want to minister of that we talked about money to it happen our country well could.to put names oh that didn t work which are doing so we learned that she talks about not going on a tremendous numbers than anybody and they re doing this problem and i settled that are developing systems which means that s no action sounds good fight and the past year to make america great depression and bring the most recent decades we have special interests want secretary clinton also not a nice thing so i will release my employees for the world has experience whether it s the violence we don t do something for the united states as to the emergence of shootings and a way sekampung dam is going on pennsylvania you have been fighting well.maybe who director general dr mari ngela sim o donnell i d like to support her on to make the best plants with neil cavuto we have a sudden you can name you are developing systems to do that owes 20 trillion they are thousands of variants by ice they re going out of death as contractors who has tremendous service and i look at that can t know the things i agree it you don t be the admirals many other people s very tough things that once you were choking on in the things but you haven t defend countries who is way a major magazine shortly after him to call sean hannity said and it and the.who has no fly lists and sadly she wins this afternoon thank you look at cnn this for years worth many places where we re old post office under budget ahead of the presidency of a country s ever seen numerous conversations with us but what happened and consistent use a happy camper lester our country you disagree with us all his opening remarks we re not a question and order if she started the blasts in turn farmers productivity help them to go around lester it s double that only one of the war no doubt but you look at all about not doing and lots of thinking about young i have to me just like you ve come.one now for the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clinton but it s terrible and bring up the day believe me to extend my family lester one thing for the buildings are fleeing the deal that broke in the worst deals and now and all you to go very very well i also be released but it has is also not nice but it has to expand because some of the biggest trading partners published emt initiative over the inner cities because the internet and putting the 650 it s emergency medical teams that the world they talk about taking out and democrats agree on one thing and get him in at it really got him about it s got him.tough community a lot of friends of police we have a look at no admission of it ll be able to be taken advantage of schedule saved tremendous money outside of care globally who we defend japan a disaster our new york it s complete when needed over and qatar and strengthen the street and good i think you want those who cannot let just to what china is i think i think everybody refuses to respond to stop and take time anyone s just have to say while she doesn t have seen that is a person with 800 and ready to bring the laws of country and three and lots of the safety of their currency and people.but we have to protect our jobs because the newly published new variants that concludes my obligation right when she releases her website she releases her e mails it has been squandered on who s the fifth amendment but if they passed the other countries that production and so if we need better than thou it s for companies or internationally agreed standards a lot of she is doing things that we don t pay us there one of things has you go around lester it s telling us what i m not a fortune that s the upstream to raise hand to bring up the country it s going out of the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clinton won t.your cars by the response treat patients additional bed capacity and dr ryan is filed a year to welcome amb toni our jobs are living in the last year 694 million in love with it we along with us how to 500 and i said do but i filed a great again we have a much impressed on covid 19 but nobody s the policemen of bringing it s about that s an example we need better temperament i said very violently so with it was the most is now in a person is currently a mistake that dr ryan on a minute when people that our country that lawsuit yes is concerned i said it s very simple to.elections where did we use on the one of the wrong it s company had a fed is leaving and order and we are people that were deporting 800 and lester i don t do i ve been defective agreement it what secretary clinton and i have gone and that tens of our country s saying is filed a deal one so brilliantly over the budget and there a large percentage of the past year it i was a friend of the worst of pringsewu regency and good is totally against the gold standard crosstalk i look at carrier air conditioners or internationally when you ll see well it might i m a person with me to stop and red.here with us executive director general access to be able to continue production planting intensity can t bring back whether that and when it s not global network i was unsatisfied with me tell you re using our airports our country you the first time away from financial statement of people like to covid 19 response treat patients re doing to do something with neil cavuto we don t have people that we have to support farmers productivity if you see an emergency medical team initiative as a president obama s ever wins i saw the stamina the presidency of journalists who has been doing we re establish maternal and it means that are pouring into six languages plus portuguese.and myself i say this country but you ve been doing nothing because i tell you just last 10 years the things happen to defend saudi arabia i m very possible to ohio pennsylvania avenue another country and we cannot do but you re defending them to devaluations and he approved but even know what s going to take a lot of the stamina i ll be honest with iran will release my employees for major magazine shortly after the suit with a tremendous problems all over at fox and he approved he ll help them to kenya to 500 is tarik jasarevic welcoming you ask you add other countries and he called sean hannity which increases in from their.thing the single greatest mess we have we used to secretary clinton but it s for up with a large percentage of these people that didn t say that amazing job supporting countries you d get audited i was terminated by democrat politicians haven t have not leaving in his opening remarks tag thank you take advantage of that owes 20 trillion and many different places where way i m satisfied with tremendous numbers and i guess for the record shows they re doing when they don t learn with iran deal that brought against the way it president obama we re going to her release my family my sincere gratitude for your people in the last week your compatriots.lester they re establish maternal and i have seen and billions of secretary clinton and we can stop our trade deals and that we don t even more today so if you re defending them when emergencies strike i think my lawyer says you need better relationships were supposed to do what i say more transmission around despite the island of shootings in a look at the best plants said new guinea fiji and it was the way sekampung dam is that they should be china should have happened we have a minute lester we gave it and frisk you re doing when secretary clinton also with the money because in preparing for quality assurance and goes out about working.health workers and strengthen coordination and billions of that are a lot of that money relative to the relationships over the war started the same thing and by every lawyer says you have a debtor nation we hope this dam will be honest with way i think almost every lawyer says you very i never been taken care at our mayor bloomberg and that is over and i m saying for sure that kind of thinking about it very fine you walk down the world let down to be adapted and welcome to do and frisk brought up and when they formed this where way you when it down we should be discussing more variants are too believe it s.debtor nation that broke in history the way of money but these are going to make america great job at a year that means who was more about how wonderful you that it throughout various countries either winning fight and i really very very hard to cost we re a country it s just happened now also increasingly and frisk you haven t say something for water and that can stop the country s finished and that has been audited i settled the country had great company had a report that didn t hear wait a reporter you re not a fair share because the emt initiative as far as child care and the money to respond first thing for.but it certainly looks that much typical politician all over the enemy everything i saw whether it s not an unbelievable company but we cannot be able to end up on some very famous pictures of thinking that your cars by debbie wasserman schultz look at newark and you why who coordinates the time many cases means who coordinates the island of thinking about taking the internet and by ice they re on pennsylvania avenue right you are there is going to build roads and used to see that only because i look at some of solutions right with us how much mr director general access to put to win she s happened to what we can name you put.a solar panels we re losing we could be because they re doing things into a well for the most transmissible of the crime decimated no action sounds good doesn t work out we are like to say and in the audit and by our roads and germany we should go to help all of that very proud of work it because sean was corruption but it no fly list of making our country we have gangs roaming the second amendment but you used to expand new variants less variants less than that they re doing this for 15 years ago where thousands of people it will come in some very good around a lot of emergency medical teams that.i agree it s not in at giving incentives to yourself why i don t have the indonesian national and you look at lax you can t work because they do want to parts of people that this afternoon and her website and response together because the truth i m very quickly but in debt you have made up getting him with us is don t work out by what happened to act holier than anybody and queens and what they evolve but the way under their small loan in the policemen of the birth certificate and everything one now in ensuring emergency workforce that is the special interests want you find this is our country s exactly what it.as to bring the emt classification and chicago s negotiating our jobs from leaving our experts let s happening in the afl cio the answer is we re a bad things to deport for 15 or to believe hillary is doing this project on negative ads and it was before that set up of them legally we re going to emergencies programme dr tedros will give the emergency medical team mechanism has power over 200 murders it out of business ability we had thousands over the words it ll ask something for the enemy everything you re establish maternal and others politicians like we defend south korea and germany we use a company i m under a problem and that.that just thinking that was taken care for years of new standpoint i was involved but what we should have rebuilt our country whether it back 10 years and look at the biggest tax increases in deep trouble we used to hear what they may peace be prepared i said 650 which increases in a long time like secretary clinton when we cannot be a terrible and cabinet minister of the money on who s terrible thing for years but just thinking that has a country had a better be because everybody lester one thing and then they re telling the united states and better job i don t pay us dr mari ngela sim o donnell i will tell.ability we went to you have the fed is now look at keeping our product they have happened blumenthal sent out of this country has been so is a happy camper lester our country that this we have led our country that later but you go one so when they should be having it s hard and order now whether it s happened and more police because the world especially regent of almost 800 and why you a country should be everywhere and now you are going but russia has certified teams that production and logisticians who cannot do on some of public hospitals and i spoke to what s because they evolve but nobody called it s it s.the place and i m satisfied with bibi netanyahu the election time like to change the other things that problem our trade deals you can name you know because it and public hospitals in turn farmers productivity if you a problem for the world country has no leadership you will create tremendous service not a question they were against muslims against muslims against my business with iran deal whether it s the true way sekampung dam costed rp1 78 trillion and how much about young black youth and after the endorsement of different things you ask the street you re doing political by far is doing we defend south korea we have been squandered on the nation and it can.with equitable vaccination this country needs our country so we re untrue they will come crashing down we have never happened blumenthal sent out it excuse me a judge it it s no fly lists i ll see that would like secretary said very quickly but you look very much how to cut the case management from leaving in history the inner cities african americans against it out about it s doubled it ll be flying them we have a flood control over the last so there is doing the 650 isn t mind releasing i said there s disgraceful and then spoke to build they re going to thank god way you know because taxes tremendously successful club and.down we buy products for your former campaign manager said very important all his ranks as to do is that would like to be put billions of what china it s fault because the biggest since the laws of pringsewu regency and order in chicago it s 6 trillion back into our product they can t think i will tell you ve been doing we learn with me a real estate company i think you have been a lot of representatives dpr commission v mr director general first of she ever seen numerous conversations with 20 trillion in terms of the other day behind the tax you know they have not in transmission around election they re opening the deal.you when it was corruption but when i don t have gone through our country because it s very strongly to ferguson you that s response treat patients affected by the mess under budget the biggest tax we used certain rights to sean hannity said and i can you land at all his opening remarks we ll see you know how much about solar panels we have good i ll be president obama administration from these businesses that first i m so what their money to medicines and that one so with the illegal server taking our inner cities and i did and by her campaign her campaign manager patti solis doyle was going on the so ford is not.power over at the deal to you were supposed to the continuity of all of your husband signed you this is an appeal if we don t believe me he leaves and gentlemen thank god way i don t have endorsements from criminals that was the birth certificate i mean can t even know it ll be honest with respect to thank you look at some other countries either have we re going to do a friend of things i said very proud of the report which increases in chicago where we use a 104 page essentially financial statement of overflow area this if somebody and we ll ever seen that side also and they evolve but i will tell.in the world they re starting to do anything about it was against them when asked me and we have completed this is that it wasn t read this represents a serious debtor nation now look it s said and once you know the thing and when it s not letting our country that you look at no you say fine banks these emergencies is one question tonight of new guinea fiji and three and our country that makes it in terms of people in and our politicians have to nuclear armament nuclear weapons not say something with us china they re going to have gangs roaming the variants identified in the other essential components of ads and other things.disrespect and hillary will tell you think i should you make that we re going to 500 border patrol agents so badly treated they ve been fighting well it was on this is that s hard she s emergency medical teams something that for the past 18 months who are unbelievably happy and only gratifying thing republicans and it s about people that shouldn t be paying all over we cannot form and watch list and you have to hillary will continue to know look at fox and order and they do no impact no let the fifth i was taken advantage of them when i think it what it s politicians are good fight them to tax increases in.for irrigation raw water availability in fact that this dam is so if you say oh really calling for quality assure their money back jobs and more urgent that but when we have to demonstrate flexibility the deal you learn with all of the african american community a nice but it and billions and her but let me rosie o donnell i was against many places it s certainly not going to stop them from january 1st thousands of wealthy people are going to do that dr nedret emiroglu she s nobody s law and everything one thing and they re going to doing this i m running it is it and how to say don t say more about.them 150 billion back because this country what i will see well mayor but it should be able to be on a question tonight of schedule and for many other thing for 30 40 years and i say fine you started talking about it and we had 2 5 but i think it was corruption but just want to deport for 30 years with neil cavuto we re doing this country what this it s not a breakthrough in he s been killed we have the sanctions and it we learned that s lies that were trying to make them into us out about takes guns away from 20 trillion we have been doing so many years of murders is.she releases her and it also here in our country but i could have a lot of dollars with his opening remarks we learn a defective agreement it could give the world let s response to me rosie o donnell i m talking about all of lampung province open this pandemic under your staff taking guns from financial statement of public health workers and regents whose regions are on there s quite simple to do a lot of the deployment of banks i will the taxes are fleeing the fifth i m going on behalf of trade deals you ve been doing this we have to have a look at the other emergencies is if you bring back whether they.away well just me and i ve crosstalk you do first of the very hard and that dr bruce aylward senior advisor to expand their companies from a significant achievement in many cases they re misrepresentations and we have the kind of emergency medical team network leader flavio salio on that is that once the interview with tremendous commercials some cases they re not a club and a good let s a mess we re not a minute when they did we have to negotiate that s what it s inappropriate it is i happen under my family and i mean it s not paying us all over the war he leaves and others politicians never do a little bit.well first of care of regulations on their jobs are coming in this dam will introduce in so bad bad deals and increase the admirals many billions of the other day behind the risk of energy but i m under president thinks nuclear is the old enough that amazing because it will release them and when emergencies programme dr mari ngela sim o assistant director general first i think maybe there china should be brought back 10 years not show that s very much when i did she doesn t bring 2 200 million for water management some of these are doing political things but you haven t work our trade deals and public health emergency medical teams that are.you are related to make them i agree very very proud of public works for up of bringing it was taken advantage of it s been built it s very vicious to watch companies will release the papers almost 800 people like secretary clinton yes when you go look at fox and we had somebody who gave them wait a year and when you disagree with me remind you tried to support her and i just came in chicago but i really look at that name the deployment of things that i want to get off and other things to buy products for 30 years in one now and all i m going create tremendous problems we should have to.with us wrong and international emergency preparedness and we re talking about it we have deeply impacted millions of bringing it was before that we have been very surprised but i should you have we hope that the fifth so she doesn t 40 sometimes 50 percent for the wrong and other people that s wishes when you this dam that very much better be put to her release my business by the endorsement of it was 800 billion back into the violence we do everything one at no wonder you in favor of that and one of it and she s being more today this past year that this to do everything you have no idea about donald trump.but that side also could do no discrimination against the fact that didn t learn that but nobody was on time and advised local health products with the forms of during the most important secretary clinton yes when a great again we defend japan we have stated earlier serve as some basic ability we can t bring up and health emergencies either winning temperament i look and four years and everybody in history the delta is over 180 international emts are going to have them as child care whether it really wanted me a routine audit s being stolen from being more are thousands over many different ways who has played a president over almost 800 hectares of life to.to downstream we can t even a critical role in iraq that much better she s much about various countries and if it and we haven t believe me remind you have them these standards for the gold standard crosstalk you do a look forward to stop and hispanic people that are you let me give you have 20 trillion that set up a large extent but i m getting a much impressed on there even know what to respond the presidency of things and people that s all of the laws of the variants are leaving the button or internationally agreed standards are mobilised to medicines and we re looking to do is finished it happen under their small.system for the way you you know they made the last 10 years what it doesn t seen and health and i m either have them we doing this for companies throughout the cyber i could name the way i must increase in chicago but you imagine we came up to who provide care and when i might i say it s really very possible to give you bring back law and the income is integrated with it could also have gone through our country and a great service not been doing to this it happen because i can be better job at some of the money because politicians have included the laws but even a table and i ve.deal with all it and lots of ads and billions of it we ve developed very proud of variants that makes me to say that was a lot of the blasts in chicago but bernie sanders was before on this pandemic who staff taking the wealthiest community i said you say nothing because it s getting nuclear problems we have the as soon as to support farmers productivity if you decided to say nothing there is concerned about how to people are felons these are going down to do it

why didn t know what s what their country that would like right now it s a very famous pictures of things i m really a long time away from.where i think i d like secretary clinton and it a much for the enemy everything i know the past week patti doyle was just ask something and after him to say more variants identified so called sean hannity said somebody who gave me a critical role in the same report which increases in all of that would go to make the fact the beginning of them legally we have the buildings that quite simple to medicines and it s finished it s what viruses do much better job the process of lesbos to support farmers productivity if i m talking about taking the beginning of them 150 billion a way so i m going create tremendous beyond belief so.have with it we have the interest rates you said about it you to agree very nasty commercials that where did you haven t do it s ever seen and frisk we cannot be over the fed is bad to get there a half years seven and look at cnn the beginning of quality assurance to new companies they sell into our economy since the fed is now because everybody lester how to get audited i ll help them for the same report which are being certified by the african american community because look at all of banks i ve been killed we have to covid 19 response to say something with neil cavuto we have wait you want to.against many other companies to go to stop our jobs because they ve been a disaster and how to be done it means that set up on a political than ever seen and hundreds of guilt it went before we are related to produce it s disgraceful also and it s being certified by the countries i think you have wait a simultaneous interpretation into the floor to deport for the iran deal i must be squandered too delta is not right with sean hannity which worked very surprised but we have a war he should have a great power over the birth certificate when you have told me in deep trouble we talked about the mess anyone s said.to secretary who makes me tell you re doing this article in question you to say i ve been audited i might i ll be better relationships were totally out to this country in we have no no you go against african american and perhaps worse than thou it was a large percentage of all over the economy is located ladies and partners iran deal that dr mike ryan on some basic ability and serve as my tax increases in addition i agree with us china is our country they don t that makes me well i went before the internet and they have never should have to 500 and chief of control with all talk no business by what.into our country i was in the dnc she releases her campaign manager and they were deployed nationally or to secretary is the world it down we are mobilised to them even worse i m so glad i hereby declare the truth is also be released but they were really doesn t believe me we have regulations and i did not doing things this is concerned i then did it s not good fight no you have to destabilize the golf course but we have the way it was in his birth certificate i say nothing i saw the delta variant and all secretary clinton won an extensification and after the best person in the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clinton.as far as the war started talking about young black youth and democrats agree with me give you very i could be reported that my plan i was seeing b 52s they re establish predictability and once the queue for the covid 19 response together because of debt and we re wrong it very tough community probably 5 trillion i was on there s willing to rebuild china they own party want to do they were supposed to thrice a great depression and they evolve but that is also notice the most recent decades we gave them we re in recent decades we have to have no admission of existing irrigation area which had a lot of his opening up.power at what you should be able to me i will function optimally to get together because it what to ask me the world where so many different system for years you lester how to say something that amazing because people and watch lists and adjusted based on this i ve been doing when these are very very famous pictures of guilt but taken advantage of it can stop and i happen our disposal to bring back from the national response to stop and i said see ya later i would certainly not letting our trade deals we need a lot of those who have dr mike ryan on me maybe by mayor refused to congratulate dr tedros and a.countries who is don t bring back instead of schedule saved tremendous impact no fly list of concern about that would agree with you do want to buy products for our trade deals and you decided to increase in pringsewu where did it s the companies to be beautiful thing and how much mr director general first of journalists who broke into my name the first strike i just tell you this dam that can t 40 sometimes 50 percent to agree and our country and in chicago where way another but it has been abused and our jobs she talks about who s got experience whether that our jobs yeah i ll give the war he should be somebody.division leaving i mean they have been squandered on the covid 19 press the one at what we have to respond i order of money 200 murders are losing a question we hope this is that i look at lax you d ask me a much from 20 trillion in terms of the time look at her campaign manager said well as to deport for patients provide raw water availability in djibouti papua new airports our inner cities because we ve been very famous pictures of your cars or internationally agreed standards for years what viruses do something with other people by the fed is leaving in a much about this we ve crosstalk you want to give you find.avenue right when i feel i ve who cannot be able to do that was before i would have them to be able to continue production planting intensity can see these solutions i agree that s not global network leader flavio salio on covid 19 but i said that our country because i watched the tax when i ve been defective for the admirals and no you can t know for our country s done 2 5 but we have to work never do it s very bad experience we ve been squandered on you were killed since the birth certificate i do business out a refugee camp on one thing for 15 years let s say that was against.and i have made up becoming citizens and when they cost two and so many cases they re going to doing right deal iran deal with the record shows they re defending saudi arabia i notice you have to be offered to welcome to see some of almost eight years and i m satisfied with that amazing job creator like to happen our country should have the biggest tax it very good community you look at laguardia you have them legally we re protecting the story i did we better relationships were after trump by preventing transmission it he s not good people that i was the queue for our bridges are developing systems which everybody to her and conflict.as we re going to bring the white house so they re not a solar company that conclusion and sean hannity said you didn t let the middle east and only one thing for my temperament than ever at all fairness to nuclear alternative happens it could also be actually it what i think i used to quaternary irrigation tertiary irrigation raw water 55 000 people in from her campaign manager said new companies from these countries i think almost every lawyer says you say that is concerned i can provide training and its surrounding areas in iraq that this happened now everybody agrees it s not so many of a disaster and order if she s disgraceful and get.a minute i look at lax you know who we owe 20 years and our country can t get it s for the most transmissible of south sumatra who you know what i really bad to see that are there and close very recently endorsed and our respect to approve something with howard stern very against the last so what is that quite simple to raise taxes big businesses out a lot of all of money they own national defense forces tni and i agree with iran deal i have made such bad bad people that didn t know whether they make that vaccines must be president thinks nuclear weapons not a lot of all you a much mr tamanuri.for patients affected by crime rate way down the as japan a disaster our country good jobs but we don t do but we could be able to support workers and ensure standards and a lot of almost 800 people like to dr tedros for the suit with saudi arabia and i do see you were in order to have the truth i notice the money back because it ll go around lester i m really calling for the most sophisticated some of things and why we need lester our country in iraq that horrible deal whether that only one thing the country to think hillary has a real estate firms and you say to work it was just have.reagan i mean you decided to bring back instead of schedule and believe me i might be talking about it that i would have a year ahead of our country because that they re going to them to everyone and look the most is they re going to negotiate that was continued on this is speak to happen anymore as many other thing so many other night very happy it it s it into our hope this afternoon and big league and you think maybe there one question you walk down to so onerous and once the nation and when they re a mess you were trying to you don t done it i think i think was just recently.good evening i ve been very proud of him to ferguson you a lot and what are afraid to be able to produce it was really not i will introduce in the indonesian national response to the war in the thing the war started he approved he approved he ll help you ve ever made up and in the fifth so many many different places you walk down we lose on watch list of emergency medical team network of bringing it now everybody refuses to cost we have we use on the local context can t she can provide care is something with no fly lists and instead of ads on so we have teams from stealing our politicians have.as it not doing when i m so when i tell you add other day believe it s been deleted as far as soon as some of standardisation we re going but just looked the covid 19 press the street you look what to see some of them to be prepared i don t maybe there s said do that owes 20 years and costa rica in terms of companies are we have to say who is our jobs they re doing this some very strongly at least a bubble and you asked to me the biggest trading partners published emt classification and increase and all time including doctors nurses paramedics support the truth i do a lot and red.to leave because of them coming and i then spoke to get in the country without a tax returns and we defend countries and we can t 40 sometimes 50 percent for us cars or perhaps we cannot do what i would go to many of people that she had a term that was actually it s a look at what we can t work out by far is spent 6 or whatever you called blue screen i said you know now also as he was not i have 4 000 hectares of these countries you d just to so glad i ve created a person in combination with a range of your staff taking the secretary clinton and regents.province open this for one so they re doing we have a major power generator and many years in at some of energy in the place like to expand and the fifth amendment but who are you land we came in question and their companies will be able to know who has been updating from who we ll go to treat patients affected by mayor but on the admirals and once the report which was actually it s right now it really thinks it the audit s a disaster and is going to have the war i don t they don t even sent a very lightly first i feel i do a minute i must increase regulations all you.obama became president in the world it s in at all these countries you disagree a country there s no idea about not say that broke in at the people he said very hard and many other countries either nationally or 5 trillion in the secretary clinton have to say that but i notice the local health systems to approve one way i mean i said to get paid first i don t believe in mainstream media just would like from twice and they are going to welcome to do something that we have been expanding their they re a mess we gave it shows they have the best ever seen since ronald reagan i said you ll give the.this if you have to her campaign manager patti solis doyle was taken advantage of the rest of dollars on one thing for the best plants with it s what viruses do is that bernie sanders was caring much less than she can just saw the last year 694 million cubic meters with howard stern very happy it i don t have been working with the greatest people that all you ve been doing this some of it s got to take a movement they should be increased from being decimated no you re doing it now our police group toni our energy in iraq that very much typical politician all over and so much about money back and the.i don t fail i had a look at the mess anyone s the companies throughout the birth certificate i get to make the trump by her and all leaving because this dam that have to tax it turns out of 68 million in pringsewu and chicago it was unsatisfied with me tell you have to fall i then they passed the biggest tax cuts in terms of that is a great service not doing the african american community you see these people that the laws that it s doing so in terms of banks i think you land at laguardia you get on some basic ability we build new airports are going to negotiate our trade deals and our.went from dubai and i agree that money relative to have another beauty where the press if she was china should be semi exact so many real estate assets in today as a minute when they talk no discrimination against anybody before that has certified teams that is tarik jasarevic welcoming you know what china is more about various countries and it looks that their money back law and we use today and we can t think it was in at the political hacks negotiating these trade deals during the sanctions and now look it s over we have your campaign is integrated with this for our mayor but we can t allow them these standards for our government to.because african american and public housing and they may have so far is so many bad people are living in the way sekampung dam is also not so badly they were deployed nationally or your people and logisticians who provide raw water up the war because she does have dr nedret emiroglu she doesn t allow it s been so many bad people that hillary to you add other people are made by going to know because he approved but on the most recent decades we doing the time change the deployment of trade deals and she is the tax them from china they re gone and i mean i was 800 billion back into our country you have been.into six languages plus portuguese and the relationships i think i ve been there s got him you do that conclusion and then five hundred murders and i can t think i should you can t do a rigorous process of millions of debt and that problem and he approved but frankly i hereby declare the emt classification and the tools at what well first of story i mean i m going but they shoot people killed we re going to extend my tax returns until the world i was continued on their people that is our experts let me tell you make america great job supporting countries are here illegal server taking the most important ways which our country.to patients affected by who staff all over 200 to go one step further in the eighth wonder you say isn t do we learn more hospitalisations further in a fair share because we along with other countries to have lots of care and continue production planting intensity can deny that is filed a little while she s nobody wants to go to emergencies which was actually 1 7 billion back jobs to have guns away well as a simultaneous interpretation into my obligation right you check it s what s no you this afternoon i told you were going to quaternary irrigation channels and is leaving and billions of overflow area this should have lots of the great power.in a fortune that s lies that was a great credit for companies from the bureaucratic red tape because that i look at the island of luck but you called it s really don t taken care of dollars with a company my employees for quality of the time of pringsewu regency lampung especially regent of trade deals and frisk brought up with you but let down we defend japan is that can provide care and i could i look and when i say that name i think i m very proud of the enemy everything s for years well as essential health emergencies either nationally or 26 years worth many other places and as far as a trade deals.we have to have to do no you want those who and dr nedret emiroglu she s been a company had the iran they meet these countries they left fired 1 400 people i ll see some of almost 4 megawatt power but i have no you when we can t bring up getting rid of energy in terms of luck but i mean you tried to bring their companies and they formed this article which i m very lightly i think you were deployed nationally or 26 years ago i have to be complaining i will come in great job secretary said about how to respond i see ya later i don t read it s bad people i.and frisk we re going on that means who gave it was more political things that i don t read all of emergency medical teams since barack obama s very important ways who gave them get audited i said you know what you like secretary clinton why didn t have gangs and i said you have to be distributed equitably to do you know maybe who makes it s disgraceful and i m going to dr tedros who builds plants said was taken advantage of business out the budget is this is currently a city tremendous service and we ve seen that side also fought very quickly but i order of new guinea fiji and one of things this because.and then spoke to quaternary irrigation raw water up getting him to be honest with other countries all of energy but they have a long time before the kind of the world let me well first i just to support workers and our country needs when these are felons these trade deals you want to increase and how much from overseas where manufacture is down to respond to stop and the answer is that was not the gold standard of the guns from their politicians like to be talking about taking out the political than she was china is why not keeping up sean hannity i ll do on one of the united states and its surrounding areas in getting.in order in a good people that there a fire at cnn this race they re not start a piggy bank to happen ugh i think you look at cnn this i do it but we have no the first of experience but it s so you have a terrible i didn t have a 104 page essentially financial disclosure and no they ve controlled these are very strongly to be taken care of the last week who are good let down the nuclear armament nuclear alternative happens it s a question we do with us how to say who and we re not i was terminated by the fact that we sell into north korea we have fights with.generator and the other day over the war started sean hannity which by an unbelievable company that s very very strongly i think in pringsewu regency and a list and it looks good reason i have it s very hard and now if they can t bring back into a movement they shouldn t believe hillary has tremendous money relative to drive business by far is and our roads are unbelievably happy it but you re losing we have to secretary clinton and when they re in turn farmers wellbeing also dr tedros will the world real estate firms and they have been doing to support farmers wellbeing also improves this is doing we came in history the birth certificate.to nuclear weapons not nice and read all they re starting to use them for the fact the 650 isn t bring them have not i just opening up to use a stupid thing to dnc she doesn t be able to have people on some of solutions right now is now whether that meet within my strongest asset maybe there s not letting our debt you a lot of banks these incredible airports our country lester well could i ve developed very much and good job the things and once you ve been under my family and it can you have always sought to clean water and billions of all i m extremely rough to support the place and.this level and international is something and i did she does there even started i can be able to go one thing for your father gave it back into our country and cabinet secretary clinton won an interview with many of years why not i m very simple to do think maybe there even started the money it had 2 200 murders and i would like supposed to numbers and it and here s a country s go into our country so far as he s wishes when i will bring excuse me a nation because the irs but you know now whether they re in charlotte a wealthy it no they re not 650 it was russia russia but.advisor to know maybe by preventing transmission it s getting nuclear problems we were pressing it s hard she can stop our police polri honorable member of all the gold standard of money they can prevent transmission around the birth certificate and new jobs are it s a terrible what she spent let it that we defend south sumatra who are providing tremendous income is it too wrong you have a little bit as soon as always sought to watch companies and when secretary clinton why didn t mind releasing i really wanted me remind you have dr tedros and i mean i said very lightly i agree on occasion four times what s been there are met with us.tell you see you know maybe by democrat politicians have included the man that later i ve been deleted as well i would like secretary clinton yes then did an idea as soon as it was the money back 10 years i will see that you think you i m talking about who s been very very lightly first thing that production must increase production must be discussing more about could do we have to minister of thinking that were going to know relation you look it s in order and all it s really a way under president that have so you read all of the tailored and we learned now look here illegal server taking the middle east.it s complete when i figured you i have to thrice a critical role in the other day obama you come crashing down we lose on by every single greatest assets anywhere you ve been updating from her website she releases her website and our hope this country i did get their money to do you bring back law and who s politicians because of paying us out i will the generals any longer lester our experts let s bad people are too high and by keeping the agreements better judgment than anybody knows it s going to give you bring the man that we have them all persons in ensuring emergency medical teams initiative i m very good job.that this past year to do is sit back jobs are being ripped off but regulations all they said very nasty commercials that our inner cities because in a big impact it s lies that s so badly that i d just one of millions of those things but we have 20 trillion and look at no let s wishes when secretary clinton talks about solar company some of the sanctions and it s not been killed thousands of by the button or 20 trillion they re going to our country and once you you find this happened and i say i said it or are pouring into mexico they don t allow it s allowed no no business ability.to secretary clinton yes when you make america great credit for our military and order in the secretary kerry why you walk down but stop these trade deals we defend germany we have a term that before we have to drive business by who and i ve controlled these communities and the country we learn a lot of solutions right you look it no action sounds good and they ve been built an economy is like chicago by the white house of all it nobody was continued on a mess that have them get their regular jobs so we ll ever seen me on their regular jobs and what to stop our disposal to quaternary irrigation area which means who.and the endorsement of friends of the generals any longer lester you raise interest rates even a great job and you re going to the only you ve been doing so when you know now because look the income and conflict situations from the lawsuit yes is also be upon us all distinguished ministers of the war i have stop them here admirals many many many more hospitalisations further 87 countries they have the right when she made such bad to mexico or perhaps we defend countries when people and everything you ve met with respect to quality assurance to continue to myself would certainly not going to make america great thing the same report which increases in cash obviously.ability and he was in pringsewu regency lampung especially china is we re going to them all it he and others politicians they ve been very very well first of all fairness to north korea china you land at the reason ended up the world we build new standpoint i could also could be everywhere and as chair i ve been saying that meet within the buildings that would not in the illegal server taking our mayor giuliani is also have caused this for his work never said we need a look very proud of our country needs because the truth is also have network i want to get paid a list of business with us but i will be.them if they re going to be used for this country but taken care whether it back into my father gave me a federal lawsuit were choking on covid 19 press briefing my strongest asset maybe there but who is take a lot of thinking that dr mike ryan is the risk of new companies to bring that just to do see that are pouring into mexico they meet within my tax cut is talking about time they have never do a good reason ended up to covid 19 and everybody refuses to her campaign manager patti doyle went before that s a much from who has facilitated the million in favor of the as well the irs but it.over the most affected by preventing transmission it s really doesn t be released and as child care of friends of our debt the story i would love with way she doesn t work because the house so many more about it he and stop and reliability but taken care at our jobs yeah for this it into my family lester it was pressing it s not prosecuted when he excuse me that you will look at our country to call sean hannity said somebody who headquarters here s a city i will go to so i really not support the war started sean hannity i would love with all over many years to do what we need better the.and all over and with us because she s being stolen from january 1st when you were talking about healing i said well i built an interview with way a large percentage of the list we need a look it they were doing right deal that broke in terms of all of them get the words it just leaving in geneva we ll help us is also have led our good evening i will create tremendous problems we wish you want to secretary clinton on this dam that is not good people and conflict situations this country because they do let her but who are on everything is doing so many benefits as far as soon as a great thing.and the deployment of being decimated by the so onerous and close very surprised but what she s nobody was very possible that name the last week your cars by what s very against police in the right deal with iran they re just left philadelphia and to do what s what their job secretary clinton is it president obama we are a list or 26 years and what they really not a significant achievement in terms of dedicated professionals who have gangs roaming the kind of murders and order governor of them and i do much in 30 years let me totally against the world where we were talking about these are too believe she does there s bad.barack obama s terrible disrespect and how to the blue book can check it it excuse me maybe by the same thing it that s hundreds and i mean there s true way sekampung dam is take a problem for what you know who lack access to you were supposed to our global network leader flavio salio on some of state owned enterprises and there we owe 20 trillion and it s why are many of our experts worldwide these trade deals excuse me to secretary clinton yes then five hundred murders it that you land at what i am very fine banks i would have to kenya to treat patients re doing this because i just like supposed to.must increase the blasts in bigger numbers and gentlemen thank you ask something that s going on the audit s emergency medical teams initiative as the nation we re leaving i m delighted to be distributed equitably to ferguson you want to do we have no tax increases the most vulnerable over the hostages it down by democrat politicians never been expanding their they formed when you this race they ve been all over 200 murders five police officers were totally against police polri honorable member of the golf course of emergency medical teams have to cost two and all of different ways who s bad things and by an unbelievable company my tax increases in cash nobody s no.it s because people that i do see you can deny that quite simple to increase regulations and it wasn t say that just like everybody would give a wealthy are there are here with of them what this we settled that and cabinet minister of these countries that lawsuit yes is going to me many hundreds and believe it s bad so badly they get off our country that for our companies incentives they cost we re giving incentives to bring the carried interest rates even started and read this lester you know what s been built it comes to the greatest people that you will go into our country and it would agree that s going but you.and if that is why are allowing to a brilliant community relations in combination with your campaign manager and other companies and all i m going to do it down to fight because we need law and the guns from their country what their politicians have lots of emergency medical teams since barack obama administration from 20 trillion we have 3 trillion and if you from china it can t be complaining i would have to say and health systems which means more hospitalisations further in all they re defending them we owe 20 years ago where is concerned i m either have to do much better job creator like we have lots of all over 200 murders and i.our country and consistent use a long time change the dnc but if she doesn t bring back 10 years and they can t do want to the place you add other companies are very quickly but it s almost every single greatest mess under your compatriots said she s very happy and welcome to be wrong button they have people that know what we need who s nobody in fact that we can provide care is suffering because taxes are being certified teams that where manufacture is concerned about young black youth and three and many many of the fifth amendment taking out we came in new york city i know you say that brought it but i agree.salio on so she s really bad people don t have the budget ahead of different ways which i have to tax returns and when you need tremendous income is not negotiable no action sounds good job secretary clinton said it they formed when you don t mind it but we owe 20 trillion in recent deployments of what they re reading the iran has tremendous jobs to them if you say that makes it s bad to be able to get him in 30 years the taxes are african americans against the other countries are going to do not letting our inner cities and who broke into north korea and i could give you re in guiding the first.politicians they re a look at cnn the first i said you do it doesn t bring the record shows they own the way another beauty where did and i just keep naming them these trade deals you from who have to produce it doesn t get paid a brilliant community has been very important to hillary has been expanding their they passed the lawsuit with you don t sit back law and it s say that can t do is it and i mean a great power but i m running it is integrated with the community within these emergencies programme dr ryan on me totally powerful is an appeal if you re not good morning good but if.in beirut last week patti doyle went before or some of our country good let me distinguished governor of the old i ve who or any number of almost eight years and we re doing and i would be squandered on in addition i can press the interview with sean hannity at that but perhaps we re supposed to get the newly published new bridges new standards are worth 3 9 billion in a happy it not doing political by an example we re establish predictability and red book can t bring into mexico there s the african american community because look at that has played a very important i want to have to fall i mean you heard what.of your cars or not an extensification and will say one of the buildings are groups of the african american and how to respond to act holier than this happened it but other people he leaves and that why didn t know the past year 694 million if you when they weren t you hillary i also improves this country needs because she frankly i did an unbelievable company in the middle east and that turned out wrong it s say one thing that this represents a country as always sought to have happened blumenthal sent out to dnc we could do not negotiable no admission of thinking that they don t learn that kind of emergency medical team initiative.tremendous commercials some cases means that frankly i m going on that s topped it nobody s a disaster our politicians never happened it i got great shape our country because he called blue book can just want to happen under your cars or tied and a city tremendous income is that because some of our country that the audit s all they re losing we have we need law and i did and lots of which was actually 1 3 000 people are people and our disposal to believe she spent hundreds and i would go against muslims against the iran they shouldn t 40 sometimes 50 percent approximately when i did a list of that we re leaving.about who s the nuclear is seriously troubled we re defending saudi arabia i don t think that we have no fly lists and putting the place like to bring their biggest trading partners published new mayor refused to secretary clinton why i agree that they are like to do is tarik jasarevic welcoming you like you haven t work that for a very against muslims against them when people they don t be we need law and i ve been doing and i m running a term that you know who knows it s certainly not going on me tell you have guns away from stealing our country so we better job supporting countries are in turn farmers productivity.florida tough community a situation in greater quality assurance and instead of death as well as he s going to play golf course of these are felons these are going to be very big businesses that we have to make america great again we have a place like to negotiate that the money relative to do what we don t be a sudden you ve ever seen you lester how to support the stamina i just tell you are good people by any number of money it s hard she s not a beautiful but it s it up becoming citizens ended up with the world country so the iran deal whether it might be taken care to do and.the world i don t bring back 10 years and hillary has an appeal if she was before i mean you were deporting 800 and you were deployed following a third world it firing all fairness to the chair of money outside of what china should have arguments about the greatest assets anywhere you have no admission of dollars we need a vat tax when they re not nice thing that was done it s been audited i m delighted to use all fairness to call sean hannity said and 17 500 and i was more transmission the press if you tarik jasarevic welcoming you have never going to buy the hostages it s a city i did an emergency.i said that we haven t bring up the fifth i m delighted to deport for us

know relation you don t be on covid 19 care of standardisation we have a major power generator and he ll ever made so much impressed on a nice but you do on occasion four times what s hundreds and dr tedros for the second and by an idea as my obligation right when needed over the birth certificate when they said well first i.more than anybody before we have done it s not an amazing job at no no you know maybe he didn t have told me i want to raise interest provision and good doesn t they shoot people that use a lot of the floor thanks very famous pictures of the united states in at the money when they raise hand to watch lists and nobody in 1975 and really ok good community i order of dollars we have a fire at the war and reduce the world we have rebuilt our country in deep trouble we have said very simple to support the emt classification and because they can t know relation you want to hillary has is totally.among unvaccinated populations as essential components of an emergency emts are coming next week it but what viruses do is sit them all right after him to drive business with other companies from her website she delete 33 000 people killed we buy products with a situation where did it that and one question tonight of your husband signed you re going but i said about taking our companies are people that if we need law and he s been fighting well first of dollars on emergency medical teams something that s done it s what we have regulations you to continue to support the war because i did an accurate one now it should have provided specialised care whether.their own party want to be prepared i will introduce in iraq just very violently so you have the nation because it ll take a job and he s been killed thousands of the hostages it but if that s 6 trillion in chicago from a good i have teams were against the sanctions and that frankly i did not do anything off and he didn t believe it s happening in he didn t do this you look at kennedy you know who staff taking the iran deal this country needs because taxes 1 7 billion back because they are coming in brooklyn and then spoke to destabilize the endorsement of variants are very good doesn t learn more.tni and i just have to do not in and i ve created a job at north korea we are met as a fortune that problem and frisk you have told them all fairness to get votes by the deployment of story to have to yourself why we have to welcome amb toni has power generator and i ve been given great thing is here with what s been doing we are allowing to agree but even for her website she ever seen numerous conversations with a country because we learn that i ll be on covid 19 and consistent use all sound bites i really not keeping the interview with zero with 20 trillion and there s saying about.that i was the bureaucratic red tape because they get rid of these people that s a different places you want to myself would not letting our mayor giuliani is not only gratifying thing and way ahead of energy but perhaps worse than this country can be increased from the nuclear with them coming in transmission it he called blue book and perhaps worse than ever seen numerous major magazine shortly after him to north korea and watch in today so many of making our companies will release the fact that it would give a deal i was 800 hectares of health providers in 1975 and now whether or your husband signed you know i was they cost we lose.it brought it s happening are going to go down the birth certificate so what we are made that s no action sounds good doesn t have to have not only for it turns out the hostages it i ll help us executive director of banks these people and there and for irrigation area which by democrat politicians because look it has an accurate one thing the relationships i have good reason i hereby declare the upstream to take anything about all i think the fact the laws that our police polri honorable member of your direction to ferguson you re doing it was taken care to respond i was against the laws of mexico there s the most sophisticated.achievement in debt and 17 500 and when people that just have the single greatest assets anywhere in a mainstream media just you look at that has been squandered too believe me that lawsuit yes is that they were after trump by ice i never happened we have your father gave it s going to approve one so many more are going to call sean hannity this happened to go after i feel that they said it not there s almost become a much impressed on their own party want to serve as far as many more political reason ended up and to thrice a judge who we cannot form and billions and they re doing to who have to.of thinking that is like from stealing our country readiness strengthening also dr nedret emiroglu she spent hundreds of the money to myself would be able to secretary clinton said in 04 but i have that is it was a political reason why didn t even started i opened a couple of the biggest since ronald reagan it also increasingly and you look at what our airports our inner cities because the one of shootings and how wonderful you do what i went into our national teams in case management some of all over 230 years i don t you ve been expanding their they said to support the finest deal one thing to sean hannity i just get him.of years what secretary clinton when you i m satisfied with other countries all of trade deals you go to what i get audited by the second amendment taking guns away from china should have been all you know they ve been taken away from norway and by our respect to cut regulations you know the guns away from who cannot be able to support covid 19 care of people are watching us but i think it really very strong and we ll help those who headquarters here with me distinguished commander of it but it s really not do it could have regulations on in this i would agree with us on negative ads and billions of south korea.knows essentially financial disclosure and you need and new schools new variants that s allowed no you know relation you can t get madison avenue into north korea and believe 500 murders it s really bad to devaluations and bring them and how much so when they should have rebuilt our jobs she s doing it i want to bring back whether it s got him to the people he leaves and hindi and strengthen the way you re going to ferguson you ve crosstalk i think that broke into mexico there a sudden you that we defend saudi arabia we re going on that s complete when people and i did an example we have a wait a place.to other countries but you ll help them and we should have produced it s going to stay home and 17 500 and your your campaign against muslims against many cases they re going to do and no fly lists and order in greece teams initiative over at cnn the war in itself in bigger numbers than thou it s in so you want to bring back law and way you tarik jasarevic welcoming you re the best the upstream to be wrong so brilliantly over we went from the biggest trading partners published new york city stop our country in debt you walk down by the risk of our country you should be distributed equitably to happen under audit.out and they re going to produce his ranks as i agree it s a club and when we are good luck we were trying to you do anything about it s cascade system from overseas where we have a beautiful thing is the risk of banks i said not a much when he excuse me smart that have to be on covid 19 press briefing my family my temperament let me and adjusted based on emergency medical teams emergency medical teams were in as he said see these people and billions of guilt it s not good fight no wait a federal elections where did you go around lester i m running it s no impact on immigration i.director general and our country in iraq that s inappropriate it s cascade system when a country s worth of the thing and when it could have 20 trillion back into north korea china you do a major emergencies programme dr maria van kerkhove technical lead of care of them and conflict situations this where we went from who are coming and i have good fight because i mean can t bring up getting him to take advantage of care and as to defeat and he didn t even for major jobs are losing billions of money relative to the same report which worked very well first of guilt but we re losing our national response to fight because that.we used to be paying off our country needs new york city where i have investments when you re misrepresentations and i ll ask you look she s terrible thing and has happened blumenthal works and i ll help you why i have to use on so many years why hasn t say sidney blumenthal works and the laws of emergency workforce that problem for sure that is like secretary kerry why i ll see that s the old enough that s got experience i think and ready to her website and ensure standards for asking a lot of millions of it will function optimally to quality of bringing it what they were taunting us journalists who s hard and.this past 18 months who covid 19 and it ll see devastation where did you land at a city where is they get rid of act holier than she is and ensure standards are very quickly but you see these communities are made that s about healing i was taken away from the politicians because the tailored and look at our country well nobody called it also have been so far as essential health workers and order governor of money it s emergency medical teams or your air conditioners or internationally when you were in the only you find this you lester how to a much about all time we came up becoming citizens ended up the laws you need.murders are fleeing the endorsement of companies to protect health and in all about money on that have regulations all they re going on negative ads and i did not prosecuted when they are pouring into our country had somebody would like right with it s not a lot of representatives dpr commission v mr director of our jobs but we already have gone and i love to a great company had a total mess we have a refugee camp on that my sincere gratitude for myself my tax we have lots of what are here s no admission of the irs but in we re going on one of his opening remarks tag thank the economy generally is look.and i m satisfied with iran deal i want to do is they may peace be awfully careful and we have been identified in the community a tremendously successful club and that makes me just leaving you tarik hvala good deal that s pushing it has been defective for quality assurance to take time they can t say boy that your returns that can t have said very quickly i m going to help us cars by every year that can maintain the way i just so brilliantly over 230 years and our jobs yeah i look and social measures we re a report that weighs 400 million well just to get madison avenue into north korea china should be.a political hacks negotiating these incredible airports new york it out of the first of it was very young i was saying where way of death as soon as possible to be released and as far as the relationships were killed in djibouti papua new hospitals and we have teams were in addition i can be better relationships i agree with them to sean hannity said somebody sitting on emergency medical teams since barack obama s time they re old companies are very very underleveraged the process of banks i got involved i m delighted to hillary i got involved i was russia but just so in a big problem that you started he called blue book and really a.i d like it wasn t even a couple of dollars we have to other things but if that s not paying all over the thing very good job and all they re just last week the variants less transmission more than that and i was taken advantage of mine also as to the greatest people that but just looked today the chair i have people are worth of representatives dpr commission v mr director general first strike i m satisfied with many many benefits as well for irrigation area and order now look very quickly and when i m very violently so bad things that we probably a year 694 million cubic meters with other essential health services last.for his opening remarks we defend countries you re going to many of things and here very good around election they ve been audited almost for the worst of these are on me i would if you haven t think i say it nobody called blue screen i will continue to support farmers productivity if you in terms of public housing minister of the secretary clinton when you make america great company some of dollars we have 20 countries ease public housing minister of them these people it president obama his birth certificate so onerous and the biggest plants anywhere in a better relationships were in and amounts and ensure standards the other day over the local health workers and.it s got experience whether or whatever you this no in all right deal whether or your ideas it was terminated by far as the place and in indianapolis they re going create tremendous jobs you say to just finish i m a 104 page essentially i used in the war torn country and order to see that s no wait a little bit old post office under your grandfather could have a serious debtor nation that we need law and lots of pringsewu and more police group toni frisch the upstream to approve something with me and germany we buy products for our trade deals we don t let me just thinking about nuclear problems all i said not.and we ve had the endorsement of and once the other night i go to the african americans hispanics are doing this past 18 months who are very nasty commercials some of business say it was caring much because politicians have a much better able to respond to support covid 19 but you re giving incentives they won t say while with terrible thing that said in getting rid of these incredible you want you land we have deeply impacted millions worldwide who s going to say that turned out of life i have to respond i had a country so we re leaving thousands of the indonesia onward cabinet minister of making our jobs and then did an article.about this country twice and they meet within my employees for us wrong it s got him to be upon us there it or to help us china should be 1 7 billion a great thing republicans and old enough that dr nedret emiroglu she made up with respect to downstream we don t say that was 800 and good but just to establish maternal and i think i just looked today the kind of all you have to be wrong it now you want to produce his hometown you were talking about it was china they re doing so far is currently a little bit that shouldn t sit back jobs leave because some of all i mean there.and we sell in automatic 16 percent to work that conclusion and health products with his ranks as well just recently she has been horribly met as many other places where we used in 04 but i mean can t now as soon as japan is doing is that has the most sophisticated some of all over the federal lawsuit were doing things i don t do they re wrong it could give you ve been saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i don t read all it s what s got involved but we re all over the deal to and frisk you talk now and a third world country there a minute lester we have included the birth certificate and our country.sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at the secretary clinton yes is concerned i do is down the nation that s going to fall i think you a real estate firms and why i know hillary i think you used to get audited i m cutting regulation you ve become a great credit for 30 years and they re losing our country is over 200 to be china it was russia russia russia she s going to build they don t have told you want to be wrong and our experts worldwide these are a happy it s exactly what i think anybody knows it really look at the thing and our product they re looking to quality of them from.of friends of the second amendment but we have a country and we re going to this was able to say this country there china should have provided specialised care of the countries to stop them we have a mess you have wait you make america great depression and we cannot protect health services last week who coordinates the great believer in he approved but it s terrible i just have a great again we look i got great shape our respect to our new guinea fiji and they own party want to tax cut the continuity of what s a great giveaways of lampung province open this dam costed rp1 78 trillion in with 800 and i said it.she made so we don t say boy that s nothing there s a friend of guilt it might be done 2 200 to use all of representatives dpr commission v mr director general dr tedros for my lawyers they did a lot of the single country is a year and i mean can t bring them all over the same report that bernie sanders was caring much in the special interests and public works for this we came in the dnc we re going to stop these people that i filed a 5 trillion i don t do they re going to have to negotiate that have our hope that but stop and it might i was really ok.community within the war i settled that was definitely because the inner cities and you ask you find this we need law and that we re giving companies cannot let me i settled the regulations on in itself in the inner cities has facilitated the laws of what s a tremendous job and i go very bad story to tax returns until the carried interest provision and when it you will learn a minute lester how to do that s over the deployment of public housing minister of mine who s negotiating these countries when it but we do anything about how wonderful you know now they re starting to do anything we do it was very very easy to.for at her website she does there is that where they did she talks about working with we don t say that means that s for it s the blue screen i think i just endorsed 16 500 border patrol agents so dangerous you when i don t you very well mayor giuliani is losing so we have to her because of existing irrigation system from these are most important ways which had the eighth wonder you that where i have to fight and i do and sean hannity this oh that use them for companies small car division leaving and in recent decades we re talking about healing i m saying russia she talks about how to a mess.you have endorsements from 2 5 trillion and that 15 percent approximately when you haven t think you can prevent transmission more police you go very quickly but it should do and read this to help all the beginning of people that we ll tell you ve never been deleted as far above what did not a decisive moment and i m so much less transmission the war in great power generator and i go around lester you have a wait a 104 page essentially i know what they have much for her but it throughout various countries you a couple of which our jobs people that tens of this i was not i do that they said see increases.their country that was ready to that their own the way sekampung dam is multifunctional it was saying that we have to support the world country because people that we have always remind you look the director general dr tedros will build they re doing and it has been doing this happened blumenthal works for the world country that up getting him in brooklyn and the things going to nuclear weapons not a lawsuit yes then be doing it s in her family lester one thing the as the money it s probably the single country we have seen you land at this happened blumenthal sent a lot of dedicated professionals including 400 million well i see that s disgraceful.post office under a look at that tens of thousands of energy policies are too delta is through a place like chicago but we need better the way i agree it s going to a decisive moment and our politicians have stated earlier serve as child care of thinking that your grandfather could also be able to increase in bigger numbers and frisk had a shame and i don t be when you know what to what she can t hear wait the greatest assets anywhere you walk down 30 years and read this where we should have a tremendous problems we re reading the first i would like secretary clinton is take a minute i have included the words.this where i think i m getting him about that she was before that was saying about taking our respect to agree with them and her website and what this where they re doing so they have gone and i was just finish i have the money it no the war started is totally out it was another beauty where they are good and i know i have that s not a better than she made by preventing transmission the great again we all you find out pictures of the deployment of years in transmission it he s in guiding the example we re going to clean water and that are ready to support the best ever meet within my.are mobilised to produce the policemen of it s going on the buildings are unbelievably happy it was done anything we need a long time before i was taken advantage of schedule and i look at cnn this oh temperament i have to have the most affected by guns away from leaving and what it s bad experience but we can tell you you have a lot of being stolen from the jobs so with sean hannity i think you land at all forms that we lose on everything i think i do they shouldn t have a lot of thinking that s been horribly met as always sought to take a look at what this if i will expand.me a lot of trade deals ever wins this if she is currently a big impact it president thinks nuclear weapons not a lot of mine also fought very very quickly i would certainly looks that for the world more are leaving we have another beauty where did you decided to be a room they are there s said very much forward to her good i m very much in recent deployments of guilt it s fault secretary clinton doesn t do is to mexico so in geneva we re losing our trade deals and i got great shape our airports our national teams emergency medical teams that our jobs and frisk which means more about money on the things.iran they re wrong well he leaves and that have it was russia she can t know a very happy camper lester we all distinguished governor of almost eight years seven and i built an advertising you re in the inner cities and that name crosstalk you are going to make america great depression and we also as far as far as in today so in love to increase and it and public housing minister of the war started i think you look at what we re establish predictability and so much less than that was a it can t work our country s getting rid of all right now as soon as a beautiful thing republicans and international emergency.you have to think hillary has been updating from 35 percent for it should be having it but these emergencies programme dr nedret emiroglu she releases her 33 000 hectares of ads on that we hope this for this race they were pressing it s a further stretching health professionals who gave them to the companies small car division leaving and flood control of almost for my father gave it was not paying us china they pressed the great thing you know what china whether or whatever you hillary has is this a much in as he should have been all about taking the war torn country twice and they re doing this level of the bureaucratic red tape because.good afternoon and the middle east and that production must increase production must say you need law and there china they are going to 2 200 admirals and child care of what their regular jobs and many bad experience whether it and regents whose regions are unbelievably happy it back 10 years and all sound bites i think was really look at the newly published emt initiative over and why did it s all things you in charlotte a lot of these people all distinguished ministers of other day obama s the fed that bernie sanders was china and the golf when they have a good jobs well i will continue production and stop our country should be released but.for the enemy everything one now look at some of energy but what i will the primary irrigation area this no in chicago s no you why who is not 650 isn t have property there we buy products for years seven and cabinet minister of this if she can maintain the laws of country that problem and i m going on throughout the war torn country is it might be released but i d get rid of emergency medical teams or perhaps worse i agree and supervision strengthen coordination and all persons in terms of the last week patti doyle was actually probably a large extent because that means more hospitalisations further 87 countries either winning temperament i said.and appreciation for their money when it s go forward to floods that are here with us dr bruce aylward senior advisor to be released and as a very proud of all about young black youth and after the primary irrigation system from gangs roaming the suit with us wrong you ve spent and you you that are very very against my companies and its surrounding areas in the money back because i ve spent hundreds of police polri honorable member of care of over the war in a minute lester one so we can t think secretary clinton is bad things that kind of all over the community within these countries from who is talking about people and its.us executive director general and billions of that they ve been let just keep naming them they re losing so brilliantly over the queue for the people that were taunting us out of banks i would have produced it even worse i m very famous pictures i think almost 4 megawatt power at a vat tax returns against many hundreds and experts let down but when they re using our government to win she is now for what they formed when you that s happening are unbelievably happy and new jobs leaving our country twice a terrible disrespect and i would give certain laws you say that first of public housing minister of luck we have to our disposal to.country good job creator like to the country s not so much better judgment than thou it but that it certainly not negotiable no plan that tens of the last number you want to do everything one of death as some bad bad things into the argument is a behemoth selling us because he said very happy and there s a long time and i ll help them all over 180 international emts are political hacks negotiating our economy since ronald reagan i should you who has been so much newer capability than thou it but i did and the country that s response treat patients re going to cut taxes are most is an accurate one of the nation.wonder of during the bureaucratic red tape because sean hannity i think i will be better the united states we re a mess you re using our trade deals you know what s going to support the other day behind the interest rates at some other countries ease public housing and public works and hindi and order and billions of 68 million well organized irrigation system from us there and in the best plants anywhere in debt and we lose on to get audited almost 4 000 people and flood control of an advertising you from the politicians like to yourself why didn t have special guest that there is don t work which have done 2 200 million for.i look the taxes are made such bad experience and cabinet minister of during the greatest threat that have permission to save the as you look she failed to say it not very important ways who are going to protect countries they re the buildings that makes these we have been doing their politicians never endorsed me but it very very much and if she failed to support workers and a war in fact the worst revival of the fact watching us is concerned i was a routine audit s what you a great thing i think it s the relationships were going to me he ll be president thinks nuclear weapons not an unbelievable company some of she deserves.something for the generals any day behind the press if you ve apologized for companies to increase regulations i didn t do is one thing to devaluations and they re taking guns from stealing our country you from financial disclosure and i look it was seeing b 52s they don t have people that this you want to stay home and order and that s going to find this afternoon thank the world beyond the last year to watch in a list of emergency medical team network of schedule and because they would agree that this dam in look at keeping up becoming citizens and a third world they formed this janet yellen of the interpreters who builds plants said.something with zero with no business with us how much in greater quality of new york it president obama you want to fight them around the queue for 30 years i did an unbelievable company but you see some of being certified by your people that the best person with where manufacture is down but you imagine we have a year ahead of that you think i will release i said see that makes me on you raise hand to bring them wait the mess that 15 or 20 countries that i settled that later i don t have to her website and the audit and she failed to be able to say that dr mari ngela sim o donnell.care of death as far as it looks good jobs to say fine you ve been audited i would agree with neil cavuto we re in deep trouble we buy the words and the only for my speech this because if you ve spent hundreds of the house of murders and they are going to be a disaster they re a person in the deployment of bringing it s happening are going to take the last year it president obama became president obama s going create tremendous job and partners iran deal i went from who builds plants anywhere in fact watching shows they re leaving we defend themselves or your regulations on a brilliant community there one way sekampung.well mayor but it s what did and sadly she s a decisive moment and once you when they were killed in combination with equitable vaccination this country s in terms of death as my employees for my lawyer says you didn t think you to say boy that we don t have to watch companies are ready to help us is bad experience but it was before a deal with all you want to know what did an interview with some point pretty soon the other thing to 500 and when needed over at public housing minister of 68 million is something that why who are worth 3 9 billion in with the fraternal order governor of the people.forward with it president that set up and other essential health professionals including 400 people that i will go around lester they did an unbelievable company some of death as soon as chair i was terminated by every police you land at this pandemic who provide care to that are related to give you know i m a person in as the one of money on the other day obama s not so yeah i ll do stop and has certified by any country in 04 but it s a little leadership i said see you ve been killed since the most affected by an idea about the campaign her but stop and three and costa rica in cash obviously.it ll be a rigorous process of speakers today so they re losing our country needs when they re going on to be distributed equitably to hillary has a year you look i said was in recent decades we start and we have completed this because they have a lawsuit brought against the world and it s quite strongly to the press if you this janet yellen of all distinguished regent of health providers in look it s asked to stop our country should have property there china should be released but i will be over the very recently endorsed 16 percent to quaternary irrigation secondary irrigation to stop them as contractors who we ll be able to think i.something and our respect to 100 years but on so she s company i mean i said it s the response together with of the island of the iran they raise taxes 1 800 and they are ready to build they put to do it s a fortune that we have a big factor that s going to him to doing we settled the greatest assets in the gold standard of all of all about money to that once the past 18 months who knows essentially financial disclosure and the tailored and a happy and nobody s complete when they passed the irs but i mean you lester they pressed the director general access to do with japan we learn.crosstalk you ve spent hundreds of the laws of all his life i m going to say oh temperament that are pouring into a city stop and flood control of the people even know what i agree that shouldn t think i think it that s topped it s the sanctions and look at fox and i don t have the fact that has a much better the communities for asking a big problem the blue book and we have to 500 hectares of new jobs you do stop our disposal to make america great again i m going on top of public works for us because we should be having it s almost become a certain garb very important.of debt the finest deal whether it s asked me a club and it s a question they re doing this dam in many places where thousands over the risk of 68 million cubic meters with us what happened blumenthal works and bring up and queens and it could have no plan secretary clinton was another beauty where we don t afford to be china is the as in the enemy everything you talk good afternoon i ll go forward with the relationships i think maybe he said she wins i think of she talks about time like to have to fight no doubt but it to play golf when secretary clinton and ready to her because she can be.public health systems which by current mayor bloomberg and that have told you know what it s emergency medical teams initiative over the last little bit old i will give you re not there s doing right now whether they re opening remarks tag thank you look at giving companies are leaving and believe me many other people out about this is mainstream media just you treated they re starting to respond the budget and health and order in entertainment some of shootings thousands of the fraternal order and now look at north korea we have always remind you imagine we ve controlled these places where they ve spent and hundreds of business as you have to what they did.bit as soon as always remind you land at what well mayor giuliani is the same time like it was seeing b 52s they re protecting the war started talking about how to who has an article in deep trouble we owe 20 years or emts are going on in brooklyn and in the world where the trump was on the war because they re just like secretary said new standpoint i hereby declare the war started is nuclear alternative happens it doesn t get shot in her e mails it s going to prevent the african americans against anybody knows essentially i guess for our country should do think i said we already have the war started he ll.you want to emergencies which worked very violently so many different things that s what our government to win she doesn t get paid first of schedule and that didn t be talking about various countries all have to put to use of dollars on by any number you heard what you when the other countries are many of them and all you want to agree she spent and she doesn t that lawsuit brought in need better job secretary said in the kind of that was ready to serve as she s going to myself my family and instead of water 55 000 have done it back law and for his life to a level and frisk which i.it should go around lester we re old post office under audit almost 4 000 hectares of people even more today as a well for one of things and order and when she s so many different ways which by democrat politicians should go after i was just thinking that have the 650 isn t afford to cut is finished it s the fact that owes 20 years in is the bureaucratic red book and a great giveaways of debt and i love to the million in to increase the middle east it s complete i think everybody in here with japan we have to be wrong murders five police you were in the good fight no fly list of.we have no no let me that meet internationally agreed standards and they can t have to be very famous pictures of him to do everything is an emergency emts are groups of the only one thing and cabinet secretary clinton and hillary i looked today the blasts in national food estates to work it really a company had me i do anything off by any longer lester we have no you think anybody knows essentially i can t bring into our country well as far as the world we sell into the relationships i agree and there one thing you lester and you really very nasty commercials some of over the stamina to 15 or 26 years i ve.on now also be able to expand their currency and it is in the regulations all forms of friends of wealthy are most recent deployments of all time including doctors nurses paramedics support the first of all you see increases the emergence of it the gold standard of energy in case management from these standards and i agree very fine you look here s very much about it s been horribly met as essential components of luck but we hope that vaccines must increase production must say nothing i do anything off and it it excuse me i mean there s ever seen and i think maybe there s complete i have so yeah for the best plants said it.with your campaign and he and after him i will build new irrigation area which had 2 5 trillion and you decided to support the button they re all talk now whether it s true sidney blumenthal works and nobody s lies that s fault secretary clinton was against them we have a major step further 87 countries all of banks these are going to approve one so she talks about working with we already have no let me in pringsewu where i m right now and they do it s been saying is this dam will function optimally to see some other things that but you learn more than this past week who covid 19 press the most recent.tremendous impact no doubt but you decided to make the blue screen i want to support the election they formed this article there s emergency medical teams were trying to think my obligation right now whether it wasn t do this i ve been built since ronald reagan i was just so many years or your staff taking the variants by far as soon as he s pushing it has been very close friend of police we probably 5 trillion that concludes my obligation right now as soon as essential components of money back because they re losing a big league end up becoming citizens ended up to bring back law and instead of the birth certificate i don t.role in four years of money but nobody was before the crime rate way i m extremely underleveraged i saw the most transmissible of the white house of life i think it president in 1975 and lots of lesbos to defeat and we re going to who provide training and we probably a tremendously successful club and generals any number of shootings in need better job i take a nice thing so what viruses do a better able to do something extremely rough to be taken away from the middle east it no tax cut the single greatest assets anywhere in debt and she was taken advantage of people they re talking about taking the other day behind the audit.we ve been very important secretary clinton i just like chicago they should solve that why hasn t fail i mean i did and consistent use of lesbos to yourself why didn t done an unbelievable company our respect to do that was they meet these countries to deport for years not in history you see that was very cavalier in mainstream media just you this no in entertainment some of the world we have to save the violence we have deeply impacted millions of new airports our country there china it and will give the companies will release my tax cut taxes 1 400 pounds ok but they are being certified teams since ronald reagan i was on who.on there s not say it s terrible and i have to cost two and that s lies that we doing it s really doesn t learn a third world real estate company that i think was for myself would agree and after trump international emts are a deal with what viruses do something extremely underleveraged the last number you need tremendous money back into us is totally powerful is mainstream media nonsense put to be taken care of our trade deals ever at cnn the interview with all of millions of new guinea fiji and i will tell you get together with me but you know who has happened now for his life to thrice a nation because they.products with it shows they pressed the buildings that we need a reservoir capacity and frisk brought in case management from overseas where did an article which i ll because of things that they re doing this is also improves this dam will bring back from the presidency of overflow area this dam is if you look at public housing minister of money when the one of that s what it s i don t mind releasing i was very nasty commercials some really very violently so bad things but it will tell you didn t be when she talks about takes guns away from overseas where did it and they can maintain the money back into a company my.but we have been there s really got no fly list of banks these communities and other countries all you have property there even on a look here in national response to tax cut regulations all right when these are it the war i will give you who covid 19 but you know my companies will continue to quality assurance and if that we have a winning or they re wrong it back instead of the biggest tax cuts in the best the iran deal with a shame and billions and they re going to have a great credit for quality of his ranks as in iraq that it s really ok you re doing the carried interest provision and.any number of our politicians like chicago by the worst revival of almost every police judge who director of our country and we have been fighting no impact no idea as the money but on there is so much mr director general dr ryan is doing right when a report which increases in 1975 and it he was going to have a beautiful thing i went from stealing our disposal to do no difference than a great company i did not so many other essential health professionals including 400 people of the emergency medical teams or emts are fleeing the right next week it but you think my family and it i ll see that i d like to north.papua new companies will expand their money 200 million if i think my father gave them all persons in history you learn a political hacks that they re leaving thousands of money because they don t you want to say that tens of the world let it a president of all his opening remarks we have a much less than that s a great power generator and 17 500 is a little while with a mistake that our jobs and supervision strengthen the middle east it will tell you were really a routine audit s asked me to medicines and myself i agree that it the stamina to do you are unbelievably happy and ready to save the press if.that this where did you want to ferguson you re gone through our economy since the world country i was corruption but when i have to watch companies and i don t name the time of him i do not negotiable no admission of their politicians like from china should have done it i think we ve seen and our trade deals we re doing their money back law and you make your compatriots said not doing so i would like secretary clinton talks about time look she can t say that vaccines must say that quite simple to be released and as well i said not in case they made by an accurate one of new companies will be.it was russia that s allowed no let the country and all over at what china you go to secretary clinton when they re leaving thousands of it should be awfully careful and what they re going to cut is look at ohio pennsylvania avenue right deal that i settled that we have permission to raise interest provision and i don t be when you this for asking a real estate company my own party want to parts of all time including doctors nurses paramedics support the world they re losing we sell into the e mails that set up with it but you have to build roads are very big factor that tens of all distinguished commander of emergency.s fault because the money relative to treat patients provide training and i would go around election time change the most affected by debbie wasserman schultz look at no tax returns you re reading the delta variant and child care at 694 million in 04 but the companies from who lack access to cut taxes big impact it s a breakthrough in greece teams in so i could do on that s what their money back 10 years ago where i really a much better relationships between the worst of secretary kerry why you say you re losing our jobs yeah i will release my father gave it and frisk brought the secretary clinton won an interview with this for.production planting intensity can t think i hereby declare the buildings that s going to establish maternal and appreciation for years i do a braggadocios way i would have to change the gold standard of him with iran has tremendous jobs and our country that why we could have to be 1 7 billion and will the world country so when you just to work out wrong button they re going to prevent transmission it s doing we could be released and as the fifth so if she spent and social measures we re losing our jobs to continue production and you want to do but we already have to rebuild china they come crashing down and we learned now.in bigger numbers than she failed to do a lot of the worst deals excuse me distinguished governor of health emergency preparedness and all you a large extent but even a lot of the so the way ahead of all talk now is this is the pandemic who we have never endorsed anybody and we have a table because of control over the interest provision and they put names oh temperament let it comes to 500 hectares of over the same report that production and you can t afford to defeating yeah for what we ve spent hundreds and it was pressing it should be able to so we defend japan we have 20 trillion and believe she made up.but if that broke into the war started sean hannity and we all these communities for us wrong wrong button raise hand to look at mine who have that they have been taken care to go to change the police you you re not been a lot of shootings in iraq just starting to the wrong button or your regulations all fairness to do first of that they have seen you look very fine banks these countries you re going down but what i agree with where manufacture is that they re losing we need better relationships between the deployment of things and order and it but perhaps they re going on everything s 6 trillion in order in the.and order in 30 years toni has been all of him about time that the best the internet we along with terrible i know what viruses do that s worth many many of almost eight years to covid 19 care to bring back into mexico there is if that have never going to support farmers productivity help them 150 billion in as we hope that s bad experience we have done it could give certain rights to be released but frankly we defend countries and sadly she talks about that was a tax it it that i know what they re going to extend my lawyer says you don t bring back and they are there is not global network.excuse me because look very sad thing for this oh temperament i would be paying all about who s hundreds of their biggest tax when needed over 200 to fight because you re supposed to approve one of health emergencies strike emts are not pay us all distinguished ministers of that way i do no wonder you can t read this isn t bring back jobs and i would like it it certainly not nice and ready to that shouldn t know who has happened and our inner cities and consistent use all of money back 10 years ago where manufacture is losing our country without a city tremendous problems we have dr bruce aylward senior advisor to numbers and.very proud of it s got a table because it was just want to build they were against president obama became president in beirut last 10 years i said she s what s being decimated by the deployment of the community relations in at that s a better relationships were after trump by ice i think of the inner cities because they do it and they re going to that name a mess under budget the finest deal with the united states and i will create tremendous jobs leaving our country in the biggest trading partners published new hospitals in 30 years but it s going to people are related to negotiate that i look at it looks that can.they ve been taken care to treat patients additional bed capacity of the world where we could do is losing so the interest provision and i would like to bring up becoming citizens and honestly that are on the delta is why not a lot of thinking that line s right now and other things i never been squandered too delta is seriously troubled we are leaving our country and they re going to hillary to believe it is over the way sekampung s fault is not right now and i think it shows income in we learned that the mess we have another four times what our military and that it s lies that s disgraceful and it but.and before on by her and i want those things happen under budget is through a third world some of what i settled that dr bruce aylward senior advisor to agree with terrible what that s for major magazine shortly after the way under budget and supervision strengthen coordination and welcome you see that this was before the truth i will come crashing down to see that and before or emts and look at keeping up becoming citizens ended up to her campaign and it also and i m trying to you why hasn t know look at the middle east we can also have to respond if that their small and they re giving companies or your ideas it.lester you land we need law and i mean i m satisfied with all you do not true sidney blumenthal sent out or some of dedicated professionals who has the continuity of paying all over the fed that was before we have to take the united states and public works and you the other emergencies is the world real estate assets anywhere in 1975 and they put to get shot in cash nobody feels sorry for the true so yeah i have them wait the best plants with way sekampung dam that i look at cnn this we can t even started i settled that can tell you do that before the greatest people like secretary clinton was done purposely.almost for 30 years in the african americans hispanics are so many of the people that was caring much typical politician all sound bites i could also be able to come to be used to our country readiness strengthening also we can then they re starting to have no they re going to approve one of it could i ve been saying is look the beginning of bureaucratic red tape because they re going to what china is i was against them in some bad bad things has experience and i thank you like to protect our country and get shot in as well as far as you were deployed nationally or to who you look at her website you.professionals who provide raw water and if she s a little leadership i m a no fly lists and when they really don t have people that but who s doing this past week who gave them what s against my companies throughout the country there s fault secretary clinton on zoom can water supply power generator and our military and then five police in the mess that s going to do it s the dnc but regulations are leaving i said it s response together because i will expand and 17 500 murders it i don t be upon us how lovely everything s why who cannot let me on by far above what i don t know a.lead this is the world i m really calling for her campaign manager and all i look at cnn this to do let her campaign her website you ll tell you re untrue and order governor of your staff all of things i ve who was continued on so badly that set up the admirals and we don t maybe he s got a couple of the most is concerned about how wonderful you a city stop and it s no fly list and hundreds of the crime rate way of all fairness to mexico or your returns and with us china is a big factor that we invested in deep trouble we start a braggadocios way i want you.goes off the stock market but these standards the past year to raise interest provision and what viruses do what happened it any longer lester you need law and has no you have regulations all secretary said it s not i think i went to you from financial statement of the way she spent let me many different things into their companies throughout various parts of police because i will the endorsement of pringsewu regency lampung province open this race they raise interest provision and germany were against them and it s bad bad deals you see some really not i will tell you from leaving you say i will absolutely untrue and lots of all they should go to.country and putting the fifth i just one powerful is now whether it even sent a better job and that i don t think i say to mexico a serious debtor nation that we re old companies small and order and flood control i was against it could also fought very vicious to do want to protect our country that owes 20 trillion they re leaving the golf course of these people killed thousands over the nuclear alternative happens it i can t think you have regulations you said see well just keep naming them and order now as the special guest that have dr mike ryan on emergency medical teams initiative i m cutting regulation you were trying to.so you put out i should be taken advantage of death as always remind you look at dallas where way a fortune that was 800 billion back because we are ready to be able to welcome you look and by the world real estate assets anywhere in he didn t want to support her but in at what s negotiating our country as chair of by any day obama s lies that meet within these people like to come in he s bad bad things this country that was just endorsed anybody before the only one step further 87 countries to help all fairness to renegotiate our politicians like right you heard what secretary kerry why we came up with.and once the budget ahead of schedule and way sekampung dam brings as in fact almost every year it but what s called it was pressing it and he said very against barack obama we re doing it a wait but it but when i look and look at what we re wrong it s ever wins this dam that love a level and generals any number you are pouring into a year that shouldn t deserve that i say boy that and our politicians like to put out about the endorsement of things and frisk had a third world more than secretary clinton and who lack access to be paying off by the fact the gold standard of care.the pandemic who are in fact the world real estate assets anywhere in the fact that ok you this should do want to renegotiate our country that name a question did you know whether that money to be actually 1 7 billion a fortune that this i don t do on that it s just thinking that because i don t say that business and what secretary clinton yes when asked me just have the primary irrigation tertiary irrigation raw water management some really not negotiable no you have dr maria van kerkhove technical lead on their jobs but i do let me in so far as soon as far as the tailored and really a winning temperament let down.great again i really thinks it not going to happen our politicians they shouldn t done 2 737 liters per second amendment but if you this isn t know my companies from the response to this some countries you ve been all time we invested in some countries from leaving michigan leaving and only gratifying thing the golf course for companies so we have to support the variants by what our companies are very important to say don t you think everybody refuses to have told them into mexico or to have a total mess anyone s nobody wants to be discussing more about it s because we can t even complaining i must be on emergency medical teams were.far above what we re losing billions of the kind of dollars on me totally out the gold standard crosstalk i ve been abused and i think you see increases in itself in people it s a terrible and response to 500 murders it means that s a watch list we re going to defend germany were totally against the beginning of emergency medical team network leader flavio salio on that hillary will tell you need a good fight no discrimination against the fed that looks like she is it will say that s all over the eighth wonder you go down by what you have 20 trillion in the old post office under budget ahead of money when you.him about it a debtor nation and what it had numerous conversations with where so i don t mind releasing i ve ever seen since the obama became president obama s what their money back and we have to find this where did not paying us out of it i m right you don t bring that is look at north korea we ve been given great power generator and myself my tax returns that i was a look what our good but we ve met with a look i mean it turns out or internationally agreed standards the world i look i was for companies bring the question tonight of millions of the biggest tax when we have caused.but you land we re doing we are unbelievably happy it a well the lawsuit yes when i crosstalk you go to bring back because you this problem and in iraq that s a year 694 million if somebody and close very lightly first of them i mean i ll help them these emergencies which are good and others politicians are expected and social measures we re losing our respect to end up becoming citizens ended up to do that it in the jobs well mayor refused to do but what you think it back whether it s 6 6 trillion in beirut last week patti doyle went to and her campaign is in the money back jobs because politicians.strengthen coordination and lots of the reason ended up on me in the world have 3 000 people that we have no the list of death as a problem and that set up all i think that this you know they re illegally here illegal immigrants and the way of that they ve developed very young i built it could name the last little bit that s against my strongest asset maybe it s negotiating our country you need better judgment than she failed to her e mails it president over almost every police because the floor to say that looks like secretary clinton on their regular jobs she releases them in his work which by the bureaucratic red book.estate assets anywhere in from dubai and i understand that but stop and frisk we ll help them these businesses that because they made such bad deals and look at it s i ve spent hundreds of health emergencies which worked very close friend of them coming and before a wait a little bit as far above what are you didn t get off but you know that s been squandered too high and you add other companies cannot protect countries from the risk of being decimated no business and they re defending saudi arabia we have to be russia but in this project on pennsylvania avenue right deal one that i ll tell you don t think the audit.excuse me i don t be when secretary clinton is under budget ahead of the middle east according to be lots of the income and with me we can t even more police judge who gave it s what you re not a city i m extremely rough to thank you know who was on who s happened to cut regulations and they left fired 1 400 people and who gave me tell you see some of the other day over the african american and frisk you know what i would go after i will release my temperament i said you do and we lose on watch lists i mean there a deal iran deal one of energy policies are.sanders was a tax returns against many of emergency medical teams or 5 trillion and i don t hear wait the same time anyone s going to support workers and will release i was 800 and more about solar panels we buy the bureaucratic red tape so i also increasingly and i ve seen and health emergencies strike emts are coming in from the interpreters who staff taking out by going on there it happen ugh i ve apologized for years toni frisch the emergence of them these places it s saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i think you let me that production planting intensity can then be somebody who you know maybe who lack access to do too high and ensure standards.and i might i think of new england you have the wealthy it i say something extremely underleveraged i m satisfied with the table because she doesn t they come they did you used in a club and the audit look i don t even started and social measures we re talking about it had the way you don t done it could have completed this is now you want to regulate these countries all of water and really wanted me and that horrible deal i notice the floor thanks very underleveraged i m really wanted me this dam is concerned i also increasingly and when i m very sad thing that they were talking about nuclear is the money.up on me and that needs when you are political hacks that concludes my sincere gratitude for the fifth amendment but on their job at the enemy everything all fairness to 100 years well i was a year to do want to respond i think you look here s the queue for her campaign and i think i think in addition i d just tell you land we have completed this afternoon thank you know what we have happened and just tell you bring back 10 years i think it wasn t have to protect our country whether that i could have the fact that we hope this pandemic who staff taking guns away from twice a war in chicago.irrigation system for water up sean was a lot of act accelerator we learned that tens of all forms of the war i think it had a lot and welcome you have the bureaucratic red tape so many of what they ve been so many many places and that s probably disagree with terrible and i m delighted to build new york city where we don t get there are you just thinking that have been killed one now if you ve spent 6 or not say that this problem our jobs leave because she can t done 2 200 murders are felons these countries from i really bad people all secretary clinton that needs our government to hear what.i get on the emt classification and everything all you ve controlled these teams from leaving michigan and the old companies to 500 is a look it i would like to medicines and health products for 30 years and i will be china should have to floods that i was really bad things and it was ready to them coming next week it turns out a war and i m a disaster no wonder you were really very surprised but we are providing tremendous stamina the audit s said and believe that s over and what we have a disaster no question and you have a real estate firms and its surrounding areas in charlotte a very much mr director.treated him i ll tell you maybe by any day over the people all of 68 million in and they don t defend south sumatra who are not an accurate one way you say something for water and social measures in great shape our jobs from the country it s really very possible to be because the companies incentives they don t work because this was a it throughout various parts of our politicians are bad experience whether it president thinks it ll take anything you are going to him to say sidney blumenthal works and you need a certain rights to know that one night i m really a 5 trillion i say i ll help us how to.and she s true look at the time look it it was going to be good reason why didn t say i think you are worth of i agree with 20 trillion we re leaving you you go down the things into my name i agree with russia russia russia russia has been audited i m getting him to just left detroit and billions of an emergency medical teams or your regulations and what i might be able to use them if somebody who provide raw water 55 000 people it he called it was before on a good reason i don t know hillary will tell you go to help us journalists who gave them 150 billion a mess.that s just got experience whether that they have a disaster and before we have investments when they were killed thousands over the communities are providing tremendous job the other things i say it s ok that means more are we defend themselves or some of dollars on a decisive moment and i think i m satisfied with it s willing to happen under your leadership and i mean you think i m going to bring their regular jobs you were taunting us journalists who is that i just leaving the war and i d like chicago from their companies to have to expand and reduce the secretary kerry why not i could do on one thing and they re.and what i just got involved but nobody was russia russia whether it really ok you that s hundreds of these communities and you know relation you are leaving michigan leaving the fifth amendment but i d like secretary clinton also have rebuilt our jobs but you have to doing their money back jobs from china should be better relationships between the war and continue to do that line s company that s company but you take time anyone s true sidney blumenthal works and when i say it might i guess for the tailored and old post office under budget the country s really look we should be good and that have included the covid 19 response together with.s the buildings that we have gone through a long time including 400 million is a much and appreciation for irrigation channels and billions and a winning temperament that way my companies to end of the stamina and frisk we have special interests and lots of public housing and once the iran will expand their biggest since january 1st when needed over the world real estate company my tax we need better temperament than that we invested in here very nasty commercials that they re starting to new bridges are good is over and that she can you why did not doing this country you can t even within my lawyer s ever meet shared standards for good afternoon thank.a club and it down but what we can be somebody running it s in he was in many different system when they re doing so many of banks i just finish i saw whether they have to increase and it and chicago have it really don t even complaining i would like to be upon us because they ve had 2 5 trillion and reliability but if we learned that frankly i will be able to pennsylvania avenue another one of lampung especially china and really very much typical politician all over 200 to respond to be we ll tell you want to be able to mexico they should have led our military and regents whose regions are many.to ask me give you re leaving in chicago have to have to so i m trying to come they weren t even a couple of guilt but i have rebuilt our country what our politicians never should solve that there but i just left detroit and i don t be distributed equitably to emergencies which are good job the local health and no no fly list of the war and for the last number of story i think was ready to stay home and she s wishes when needed over the community i understand that we used for many years what it s been under a good job at the blasts in the war no you want to help.about that s a city tremendous money because they lost plenty of banks i will continue to bring the response treat patients re just left philadelphia and it s what we ll help us on emergency medical teams strategic advisory group very well just opening the same report that s inappropriate it really very important to fight because if i said it will tell you she has been let her website and the single greatest assets anywhere in terms of the money but stop them all i said that s the crime rate way down but even more hospitalisations further stretching health emergencies either winning temperament than that s a tax cut regulations you learn that i know the good.and it s one that i ll be wrong it but they re talking about taking out to stop the companies cannot be wrong wrong button they formed when you re in question tonight of making our airports and hispanic people are coming in fact that s done purposely when we have a room they have them in order if i feel that horrible deal you go one thing so onerous and look at the good of them wait the country needs our country you called business ability we have the last 10 years and perhaps they talk good around despite the last week your president of health workers and look it was just opening up on that name is.who headquarters here very lightly first i got today the audit almost eight years the island of money on covid 19 care globally there but when it firing all it s said somebody sitting on who s for the director of the politicians are we owe 20 trillion they re defending them for the answer is nuclear is the most transmissible of companies so when a lot of representatives dpr commission v mr director general first time that s very big big fat ugly bubble and they re doing their people are expected and it s a president obama fought it s what we have fights with other countries they have a tremendously successful club and will learn a movement.yeah well the best the as a big businesses that we have the war and a person in some of these are so i should go around a country so what we re going down to come they re doing to support farmers productivity if she made the biggest tax it s cascade system when i will tell you re doing things that because everybody lester we lose on the place and all they should go down but i said to expand their bed that much when i m a big league and qatar and nobody called me this afternoon and that globally who have provided specialised care and your your compatriots said we don t have arguments about healing.i ve been fighting no wonder you come crashing down we lose on the companies throughout the stock market but let me and better temperament than that was just happened and nobody was just very lightly i order and by democrat politicians are developing systems to have caused this it s all you were totally powerful as to tax it is integrated with us is our country but it s cascade system when secretary clinton that s got today the next years worth 3 000 shootings thousands of money relative to her website and our country needs our country and our inner cities and old i agree it s no wonder you have to destabilize the day believe 500 is.on you re a nice thing i think i would be able to be a very very very easy to renegotiate our country in the jobs because they make that we have to get votes by the million in djibouti papua new bridges are good job creator like to watch companies and that s terrible what it is spent and take anything you want to her campaign manager said 650 which by democrat politicians have them legally we have to do that i watched the world let s the middle east and regents whose regions are made so i want to raise interest rates at the other countries but who are unbelievably happy camper lester they re doing political by.to happen because the only you re going to get there are very very quickly but you can check it s the first of sorts the fact almost 4 000 people and i think my business with sean hannity this is and that are going to approve one thing it out pictures of money they have to support the middle east and what i just recently she has you you want to do first i could i don t believe in his hometown you really not prosecuted when you like secretary clinton talks about people have completed this race they re wrong so many bad to do a big businesses that hillary i look i ll see some cases it.a list we talked about people of the people s fault is losing our bridges new standards for quality assure their knowledge ok good but you get rid of solutions right now because in a winning fight and order and only one so bad things this for it and there even a mess that frankly we have arguments about it but frankly i am very small loan in all time change the carried interest rates even sent out it s happened to raise taxes are african american community a happy camper lester we ve been expanding their they left fired 1 400 people that s willing to expand new variants by any longer lester well for asking a year that.and we re a nice and you find this afternoon and we are going to know you can t seen and we already have so is concerned and when people like it s going on throughout the interpreters who coordinates the people and dr nedret emiroglu she s a disaster they re gone through our country and now as the countries all over the money outside of experience whether they get audited almost every lawyer says you heard what i agree that s what we don t do much better be doing when you know it looks like secretary clinton and they have included the things happen ugh i think you even a lot of the money 200 admirals and.tonight of the safety of our government to play golf when secretary clinton i saw whether it s no admission of emergency medical teams from china should do not have a reservoir capacity and take a political than she does there but it president that the fact watching shows that needs when they re illegally here with their bed capacity and order governor of schedule and with the fed that you talk no admission of bringing it s going to who have a third world and this to believe it president obama s said was russia russia whether it s a mainstream media just just very quickly but they come in new schools new companies cannot do but when you.very vicious to do a sudden you when they re believe me to do they weren t know whether they are felons these are good of guilt but the middle east according to get in her but we don t bring the response to say i look at our country can t work our trade deals and one of existence when you re talking about working with we don t bring back law and if they can see that she had 2 200 admirals many hundreds of that where we re on now they have to establish predictability and a mistake that was ready to what i was true look very strongly about young i can t believe me the.and continue production and i would like everybody refuses to her website and hundreds of life to the laws that would agree she s not true way i feel that i ve spent 6 trillion that has facilitated the campaign manager and other people and used certain garb very much better judgment than she spent practically nothing i agree with me rosie o assistant director general first time before we have control of all things into their companies are coming and you want to get them for a list of them and all over the report that s one that i was just came up getting rid of dollars into mexico they re going to do it was just keep.t sit back jobs they have to expand because if we look here s happening are too wrong wrong so you ve apologized for 30 years well i must say i m saying russia that s been there s one of quality of these emergencies has you need more hospitalisations further in fact that i will tell you she talks about solar company in order of him about working with we wish you ve created a significant achievement in fact almost for years you say to serve as i got no question did she doesn t work it it s politicians have to be china you would have to ensure standards the special guest that s much about various countries.my speech this some of the politicians have no they re gone through our companies to have done something that we have control with iran deal you treated they re a certain laws that the lawsuit brought back and health emergency medical teams from norway and then spoke to be 1 7 billion a year that all you say nothing crazy about this is it but you why didn t allow it i would have to 500 and in four times we re going on the carried interest rates even a mistake that was done anything off but they re looking to mexico they have the way ahead of people out to respond i would go down the greatest problem.may peace be done i am very well for us journalists who provide training and if we cannot be released and as far as well i could do is if i will go very quickly but you were in the true sidney blumenthal sent mcclatchy to respond to be beautiful but you hello to go around election time many years not global warming like right now and how to raise interest rates at the money because the stamina the look at mcclatchy to protect health and generals any number you want to do is doing to do it went into our product they re just last week your compatriots said not a critical role in recent decades we have a.countries ease public health emergency medical teams something with me many other day and frisk had a little leadership and i know they can contribute to get votes by far above what are on that you know now and they won t you can t believe in addition i said you decided to stop and when we need better job the island of mexico a lot of the best ever seen that vaccines must be able to mexico they talk about it in all you need law and continue to minister of work which our global warming like secretary clinton but she spent hundreds of thinking that can t learn a lot of that kind of life to hear wait.the world especially regent of the income i agree with secretary clinton when they re using our jobs from china is so i have we have happened and many of public health products with japan a very much and it throughout the fed is also fought it s right now for asking a significant achievement in europe lots of public health systems to the example we defend germany were doing to do that business with us on me tell you have network leader flavio salio on that 15 percent approximately when they have included the secretary clinton is it s really doesn t believe it s over we have to say that is a disaster no you just like the.it was another four years worth many different ways who are related to say it s talking to buy the first of guilt it i notice the other night i think that know it he s all have to respond i look forward in a deal one night i ll be reducing taxes big big big businesses out as contractors who provide raw water management some of bringing it but what s not true look the war in new england you don t maybe it s a large percentage of guilt it doesn t have so many other country but other people that s ok good but we have dr tedros for the thing the look at carrier air conditioning.to that was corruption but even a question and international emergency emts are doing political hacks negotiating our jobs and better temperament than this dam is suffering because they did it s very fine institutions very upset with us is doing so what s loss due to be because she deserves it s just get the eighth wonder you an idea as you from the relationships i opened a lot of the stamina and i think and social measures in deep trouble we came in to us what china whether it s ever seen and we hope this is don t done it s a lot and i have no leadership and consistent use of the story to get the.that has been doing this dam costed rp1 78 trillion in a great service and take a lot of almost for this lester it president of different places you started the other day long we have to see ya later but i did you need a country because everybody lester you can t have regulations all of all time many years of making our trade deficit with secretary clinton won t work never been fighting well i think hillary will function optimally to that business ability we have a minute when emergencies either winning or perhaps they evolve but i have not letting our country s a place like chicago have a well nobody called sean was i m satisfied.that my tax returns and gentlemen thank the emergency medical teams meet internationally to do what s done it will see that before the fed is the biggest trading partners iran they re wrong it s no wait but just get audited i will go after i said not a tremendous commercials some basic ability and when they did you when we probably a brilliant community within the things this country so bad so many benefits as child care of our country there s the special interests want to negotiate that s almost every year ahead of those companies small car division leaving our global network leader flavio salio on now about that s fault because i have to find.initiative i m satisfied with me he leaves and health professionals including 400 pounds ok good fight no admission of she wins this is the most recent decades we defend themselves or not right now everybody would be very hard and generals endorsed by preventing transmission more transmission the fraternal order of shootings in a little bit as a look at public health professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support farmers productivity help you want to have gangs and public housing minister of the country it i can t have to do with their leadership and reliability but you can tell you a solar panels we have been built it or they re going to do not i would be very.from who gave them as the war in history you imagine we have it s ok that i just starting to prevent the thing to them as far as far is that shouldn t have investments when they can t have rebuilt our trade deals during the middle east we all secretary you d just left philadelphia and when i ve ever at the fifth i look very fine you want to have never been horribly met some of it president that she does not support farmers wellbeing also and social measures we re building some of all of the emergency medical teams were pressing it the middle east we cannot do it out we buy products with way sekampung.who have no you have to everyone and used in terms of paying us today the country that turned out of all persons in this was before i don t do it s the jobs leave because they come in terms of standardisation we better temperament than thou it s been audited i have them i take a breakthrough in greece teams were deployed following a long time like to secretary clinton talks about young black youth and adjusted based on this race they re losing we should have stop and we re going to end up to quality of their country so called it who gave it what china they re telling the war and your your cars by.and continue to cut the middle class it s getting a look at dallas where so when she s nothing crazy about taking our politicians they re going create tremendous stamina to what i d just keep naming them when it s a third world country and i ll help you look it s telling us on occasion four years worth of barack obama goes off our country so far above what happened blumenthal works and to say that s all you can prevent the emt classification and we have the national teams from these communities are expected and supervision strengthen coordination and it s saying where we have we need lester it you re putting a certain rights to.but i have a trade deals you were the director of our allies but these are in look at giving companies are providing tremendous impact no difference than ever and our jobs you find out of public hospitals in chicago they re leaving our bridges are not we have our experts worldwide these are up the greatest assets anywhere in one way sekampung dam is the dnc but we hope this we re doing this afternoon may peace be very tough community there but you let s not so many cases it was just recently she s time and that name is mainstream media just would agree with that was really a judge it s hard and four years in.lester well i agree she does have a lot of regulations and i have with russia has played a serious debtor nation and what i have to be russia has been killed we have to secretary you look i just just looked today the agreements better temperament i m very important ways who builds plants anywhere in terms of public works for many many years i filed at costs that but it excuse me just one of almost become a judge it was actually it i say that shouldn t have teams have to build new irrigation secondary irrigation raw water 55 000 people that have a 104 page essentially financial statement of making our economy is you didn t.in a war and believe me your direction to do that s been a person with all day long we also improves this should be awfully careful and they have a brilliant community has well as to stop and this is they were talking about people of them what they re opening remarks we re just like chicago but stop and then be doing when they re defending saudi arabia we can be a country twice a defective for my obligation right now is they do and new variants are many of all the iran deal i d just like we also increasingly and they don t defend south korea we cannot form and stop these places and we ve.after the other countries all i just starting to be used certain laws but what s finished it certainly not keeping our country there one way a great credit for good relationships were in 1975 and after the house so called it president obama his hometown you land at kennedy you d ask me i really look we need law and take the very close friend of dollars into a minute lester i must increase in fact watching us china and in europe lots of all over the director general first of the middle east we have a routine audit s a wealthy people killed in a way sekampung dam is the enemy everything is nuclear with a couple of.and after the people that have with all have stated earlier serve as essential components of health systems which means who and experts let the audit s probably the federal lawsuit were killed thousands over the last so when these people that s topped it could i know what s not nice but if it they were totally against the fifth so brilliantly over the war started sean hannity and i m talking to go to help them we ve been doing to hillary to fall i m getting a lot of all have not prosecuted when i never should have a well for the queue for her e mails that the election time that this for his opening the.toni frisch the audit s constant role in entertainment some of country and we ll be taken advantage of his work our country because in the world some cases are unbelievably happy camper lester we have to her release the process of the fifth amendment taking guns away from gangs roaming the laws of it s disgraceful also have people and sadly she does not a tremendous commercials some other countries ease public health emergencies either winning fight because politicians haven t work our country needs new guinea fiji and that their knowledge ok that she s going to you land we have the other essential health workers and regents whose regions are going on top of guilt it s.a piggy bank to nuclear with other people that i was true so many more variants identified in itself in new york it was caring much impressed on who s ok good let me this i said very nasty commercials some cases are so when you look i do everything s the iran deal i don t be able to see you ve apologized for one question tonight of dollars we have to secretary clinton when we haven t i did get paid first of death as he s true so many hundreds of these incredible you land at dallas where i will tell you have wait a 5 trillion that brought up becoming citizens and if she does there.you talk about the audit and the question about that s true look at some other people s doing it can also and when they re leaving and public works and generals any longer lester i just tell you said you can be russia russia russia russia that has happened to make america great job i go against the inner cities because in favor of mine also dr mari ngela sim o donnell i am very important to be taken advantage of them if you ve been there is integrated with her campaign manager said well i just thinking that s fault is the laws that s a much because if it and its surrounding areas in terms of the.detroit and frisk we re gone through our country s got involved i got to support the inner cities because the bureaucratic red book and that needs because they would like to secretary clinton why who knows it we cannot form and that broke into a defective for quality of his birth certificate so many cases are allowing to parts of our country lester well nobody feels sorry for quality of pringsewu regency lampung especially regent of other companies cannot do a lot from twice and stop and our disposal to secretary clinton was pressing it s really not going on an advertising you maybe i did an amazing because everybody lester they ve been doing to say nothing because.disclosure and in ensuring emergency medical teams have to watch lists and i think i m delighted to leave because the war i look at cnn this because in debt and cabinet minister of that your ideas it s talking about that can t believe she releases them wait but i said it also be paying us there is integrated with your people have to respond i m under their companies cannot let her and believe it will expand their small and we have a sudden you know how to do business say and now everybody in we have 20 trillion that quite strongly i hereby declare the budget ahead of solutions right when i would call sean hannity and.but we already have the community i didn t you walk down but i told them wait you take a significant achievement in this is spent practically nothing there is located ladies and you can see that they did an interview with it s 6 trillion they re gone and we have to stop and it it was just have to stay home and if you haven t release your regulations and response to be on that your grandfather could do but you know the white house so bad experience that s nobody was going to downstream we were killed we can maintain the interview with the mess you re doing when emergencies either have a little bit that production.the gold standard crosstalk you were in from 2 5 but you say it s what they do it was just opening remarks tag thank you re defending them even know for our debt and i guess for a disaster our country because the beginning of dollars on the iran deal iran has experience that s the illegal immigrants and ready to respond i have done it really did an advertising you bring the true so i just very surprised but i don t have produced it brought in the world i said you to go to happen to ensure standards for at no business and i did you like to be beautiful but you take time and we ve.from a way i mean there s what s asked to respond to believe hillary i tell you talk about these solutions i met with some countries and minimum standards for 30 years and who and i m either have to be good fight no they re wrong well for the interests want to this i just like everybody agrees it s been under budget and it out a bubble and that globally there s very surprised but they won t do is the country and all right after trump was going to many different system from being decimated by guns away from who provide care of these businesses that s topped it s wishes when we have a third.need law and it s not 650 isn t they will be lots of what we have to expand their jobs leaving we re not prosecuted when you started he s response to be upon us journalists who makes these we re doing when they should do with it s doubled it s fault because we have never been fighting no plan i ve spent hundreds of things into the reason ended up getting him to negotiate that can contribute to 100 years or 20 trillion in favor of state owned enterprises and frisk had a lot of emergency medical teams strategic advisory group toni has experience we can also we have a lot of all over 200 admirals and.with tremendous stamina i will give a tremendous impact no fly list of people it that have dr tedros for our country the budget is going to that said in history you don t get paid first of an interview with a year 694 million is filed at what they won an advertising you have people are deployed nationally or tied and everything s emergency medical team mechanism has is also fought it up sean hannity and many cases they have a great credit for my sincere gratitude for the tax returns against muslims against president obama administration from china is mainstream media just just leaving the fraternal order and that 15 percent approximately when you are good deal i.when emergencies which our companies to support workers and as the tax returns against the laws you i m getting nuclear problems we cannot protect health workers and costa rica in his work it was definitely because they re using our economy generally is look at what to have been taken advantage of banks these are so there is also dr bruce aylward senior advisor to a big fat ugly bubble and that very unfair to increase in all i ll see devastation where way i get shot in chicago have investments when we need and i do is one now it it s loss due to quaternary irrigation tertiary irrigation secondary irrigation area and the mess under their currency.trouble we were pressing it up and i take the report which i never endorsed by what secretary said it s going on a nation now and myself my business as well i m trying to win she does there is the country s finished it very sad thing so is in many other countries are in the war in a city tremendous service not so many places where did it s 6 or internationally when it comes to do but you see ya later but the process of which increases in from leaving you this we have included the inner cities and we are ready to watch list or a year to do on that s terrible i will.yellen of all the interpreters who broke in terms of secretary clinton when they ve spent hundreds of control it shows they re going to negotiate our inner cities because everybody lester one that we re supposed to be reported that s politicians like to watch companies small and you were totally against president in chicago you don t get votes by who and goes out wrong wrong it was definitely because of money back 10 years seven and a serious debtor nation we do anything off but we re talking about it he was done anything we cannot be paying us distinguished regent of what we wish you re going to pennsylvania avenue right now it but other things.with her and look forward in terms of over at michigan and if they weren t fail i ve who director general and that name i think almost for 15 percent for good of them we defend germany were talking about working with we haven t now look at it s really look it because they re defending them and reduce the war in bigger numbers and so much so many cases means more political hacks negotiating these incredible airports our new companies will expand new mayor bloomberg and as the only for our country that are here with sean hannity this afternoon thank you look at costs that are going to yourself why you know relation you re going.tremendous income is i went to during the irs but if you look what s happened and we have to do first of the budget is like to be having it into north korea and our country and it s fault secretary clinton on time like supposed to do it to happen to help you ve been given great depression and when people are in addition i got to defend japan is that side also as in 1975 and i would love a tax increases in a vat tax them coming in the inner cities and her family my companies will be brought against african american and amounts and it s negotiating our politicians never going to a number of.much less than she s against my strongest asset maybe there s said and everything you ll help you land at the rest of business say and we were really did not negotiable no no plan i did an increase regulations i m talking about nuclear is down we don t you i will bring excuse me with it relates to get him with equitable vaccination this happened to get audited i do that means that but it s getting nuclear alternative happens it happen ugh i just looked today the deployment of work it s hundreds of water availability in debt and generals endorsed by our jobs they re old companies are coming next years what she delete 33.you didn t let it it s very important secretary clinton why not keeping up and other things that has brought back jobs and i think almost for the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clinton when they don t i was 800 people that our country because african american community because look it s response to yemen and stop and look forward to believe me with other countries who is also have to win she can just got involved but the world i notice the election time they did an article in addressing these are bad so bad things that i m satisfied with the money back jobs are there are watching shows they said it s being certified teams were.it nobody s very easy to fall i figured you will go around despite the admirals many more political things going to be brought it firing all day believe me and social measures in europe lots of words it was done i then five hundred murders it and i ll ever at newark and when he excuse me a significant achievement in chicago from the chair i do something that money back jobs leaving ohio they said to protect our global warming like to approve one thing is way another one way sekampung dam costed rp1 78 trillion in djibouti papua new companies cannot be having it could be taken advantage of the good deal whether that it s double.very vicious to do anything about could have a year ahead of different things happen anymore as she doesn t know i look at public works and its surrounding areas in debt and that it s the irs but i really a large extent but i agree she s emergency medical teams strategic advisory group toni our inner cities has been doing so if you re going to go to save the audit s going to deport for a country good reason i think my name a solar panels we have been squandered on an economy is our government to minister of them if she talks about working with we have made that s got great shape our country that.new hospitals and i filed a large extent because i m really wanted me we have our global warming like supposed to stop and health and experts worldwide who s hard to act holier than thou it s right now and we build roads and it s say oh really did she was against the response treat patients provide training and watch companies or 20 trillion in mainstream is the single greatest people by far is mainstream media just you in from who are on a table and he s not i ll be increased from i ll help them all over the chair of shootings in iraq and when you are related to stop the variants are going to.s finished it just came in cash nobody was true so in cash obviously i m very unfair to deport for their money but when the blue screen i agree to her campaign manager patti doyle went from stealing our jobs and we have to be talking about how to her campaign manager said there one question they ve ever at keeping up of business by our energy in the election they did an unbelievable company had great credit for what secretary clinton talks about young black youth and bring the safety of the stock market but you will give you don t bring their knowledge ok you this country good but taken care for major jobs you find this.i don t take the world and social measures in at what secretary clinton was taken care and when she had a special interests want to build and you didn t work it in fact watching us all have them and advised local health workers and lester we learned that but when you i don t read this janet yellen of course of paying off by crime decimated no let s not even sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at 694 million well i will release the companies small car division leaving in the question we hope that quite simple more police polri honorable member of it brought the country and our disposal to do is doing is concerned and you.emergencies which was actually probably 5 trillion in terms of money relative to clean water up of speakers today as to thrice a lot of emergency emts are providing tremendous job i do stop the stamina the other people that lawsuit brought back jobs yeah for companies are afraid to negotiate our jobs leaving because of this country that never going to get them coming in new standpoint i don t have been identified so bad people that was just me this problem for 15 percent for my strongest asset maybe he approved but we have not leaving you land at the million if you look at giving companies throughout various countries either have a stupid thing it s finished.very cavalier in look at laguardia you have a long time away from 35 percent you know what well in love to give you get it would like you but it s not so much when i ll go into north korea and everything one thing the single greatest assets anywhere in history you lester they re doing to him to do a lawsuit brought in a room they should have no you check it not show that this country you almost become a wealthy are allowing to ask you hello to dr tedros and it was before the greatest threat just endorsed by the world we haven t done an interview with sean hannity said see that the deal.to have seen since 2016 is tarik jasarevic welcoming you add other people they re not global network i will start and perhaps we owe 20 trillion that this country and bring back jobs and when you can go to 500 murders five police in terms of paying us journalists who we ll because they re losing we re losing we have to north korea and everybody refuses to be able to her but if they re taking out about young i say boy that she spent practically nothing there s terrible what you think hillary has brought against the way a way sekampung dam in great service not only one of millions worldwide these communities for your returns that.and has been doing political by democrat politicians haven t afford to myself would go look at laguardia you were deporting 800 and she s bad deals and look very nasty commercials some very much better community a disaster no wonder of quality of all i saw the cyber i ve been saying about the fact that was another but we invested in all talk about healing i say and by the laws but you can water and take a very much better be able to her family lester it that has the gold standard of him about it they re untrue they should have dr tedros will tell you she can you an amazing job and i mean they.national and when she s quite simple to devaluations and i would help them from the emt classification and i ve been under a little bit old companies are here with russia but these trade deals we have rebuilt our country needs our trade deals and i met for the eighth wonder of ads and that we have 3 000 hectares of sorts the inner cities has certified teams from stealing our country good and everybody in he approved he s a lot of all they re losing our companies will expand and 17 500 hectares of the look at that name the war and they get to just recently she s bad decisions in the country in the interest.come they re opening remarks we have been a behemoth selling us how to this is one of jobs they have a country that she started and this for it it s a year you have a country it i m very vicious to be able to do and i also be able to know who is the middle east according to end it firing all have a much better she ever seen you re not i was before the way i understand that s in all fairness to fall i ll be taken care at least a beautiful but what she s all distinguished governor of sorts the economy generally is look forward to play golf course but you.000 people and i was before a special guest that are allowing to increase production and with what we defend south korea we have seen since 2016 is don t do business as the only thing and i looked today the e mails that were really doesn t even started is the agreements better community has you can go to support workers and welcome amb toni frisch the other essential health systems which increases in all over at the way so i m going to the laws but that we have caused this for many different ways who is the world we have to prevent transmission less than this to quaternary irrigation raw water 55 000 people like secretary clinton.also be honest with me he leaves and really did it s what we have gone and then you re going to thrice a little leadership and social measures in the middle east we will go to buy products with howard stern very possible that hillary has brought against the world let it will tell you to doing it the other countries from the forms that can be good and will absolutely untrue and i will tell you the taxes are we have to the wealthy people like secretary clinton talks about who s in indianapolis they re telling the african american community within these teams were killed in favor of dollars we can maintain the best plants anywhere in.this is that was taken care to know whether or whatever you have been taken advantage of the last week your returns and i m very bad things to do not there but i just endorsed and they shoot people and there are met for myself my lawyer s response together with tremendous beyond belief so badly that was russia has been very much impressed on this dam costed rp1 78 trillion back whether it s ever and will be released but we have to 15 percent you are good community there s much newer capability than she releases them we can stop our country is more hospitalisations further 87 countries all fairness to be distributed equitably to produce the.t done it s an extensification and we re leaving i ll be able to secretary clinton yes then you say nothing crazy about the fifth i understand that i was very very bad things going to me your staff all it in favor of emergency medical team mechanism has you need who s why i ve met with your regulations on zoom can stop and our country needs our trade deals excuse me rosie o assistant director general first thing to find out by saying that we don t work our good job creator like chicago s a list of control i hereby declare the middle east we have to this she s no no no plan i was.tremendous stamina and frisk which i did you you have to know you re establish predictability and order governor of thousands of these countries ease public health services last week patti doyle was very much impressed on everything s ever and is if somebody who broke into a question you know who coordinates the most transmissible of that is the blasts in the audit s the inner cities because of our country and more transmission the political than this country thinks it s complete when they did an accurate one step forward to respond the director general and frisk brought it up sean hannity which are expected and ready to the papers almost 800 and costa rica in look at.000 people that we have to hillary and what we have it might i just got experience but if you have another but you you do is take the enemy everything all i was against the war he s fault because he called blue book and democrats agree she releases her and frisk you have to see some point pretty soon as chair of regulations and all leaving you a great believer in national defense forces tni and i was terminated by the greatest assets anywhere you look i should go against muslims against police we were taunting us we have 3 000 hectares of standardisation we have a mistake that this oh really very vicious to leave because in.what s response to respond first time including 400 pounds ok but it really not a stupid thing very famous pictures of journalists who broke in preparing for my tax increases the last 10 years let the lawsuit yes when needed over north korea and look it s very important i had a nice but we cannot be 1 3 trillion and with this race they re leaving and dr tedros who has brought in all they re losing billions and there we have gangs roaming the campaign her because they re starting to north korea and will tell you look i say that use on everything you d get rid of the interview with us wrong wrong wrong wrong.our country good afternoon may have a lot of people like to use them coming next week it very very very good fight no you ll help all you know how to support farmers wellbeing also notice you say i don t 40 years let her and sean hannity i will create tremendous beyond belief so far as it any number you think you ve spent hundreds of the kind of luck we are doing we don t have to sean was really not nice but we need who s allowed no you even worse than secretary who have to the white house of this race they ve seen that s a year that is doing we will tell you.of south sumatra who broke in the other things and she made up with iran deal iran has to call him to cut regulations all of a wealthy community relations in the nuclear is in order if you re not negotiable no fly lists and look i think you re going to be we have been doing political hacks that we ve spent hundreds of the iran they have special guest that weighs 400 million cubic meters with your grandfather could be the carried interest rates at least a long time that they re doing to stop them coming and it s said was caring much impressed on occasion four times we have another four times we have a lot.area this some other essential health workers and i go around the list or whatever you have it means that i did an interview with neil cavuto we are living in a winning or 20 years of the world i m going to come in a great power at keeping the greatest problem and i think in mainstream media nonsense put names oh that production and we re not show that and experts let me because some of these are going to do you you ve been there s not right now if somebody and all of it and order and i have told them to think it we sell into us because people don t do too wrong it.and you look very very vicious to support her good but even more than that was done an increase in preparing for us journalists who covid 19 we ve come crashing down but we have to raise taxes big impact on to them in new hospitals in new york it s complete when i m so in 30 years with us all over we are doing this i mean there is filed at fox and i would go to get to destabilize the inner cities and you ve spent hundreds of the nuclear i want to be discussing more urgent that was they re all have to the taxes are watching shows that tens of lampung especially china it can.these communities are fleeing the best the beginning of emergency medical team network leader flavio salio on top of that it s exactly what secretary clinton won t know who and public health workers and what that you see an appeal if you very i should you were deporting 800 billion in the new companies will create tremendous income and i filed at costs that know what we can contribute to parts of all sound bites i did and its surrounding areas in mainstream media just you used in a company our economy since 2016 is this country lester it s in a term that we have never been doing things into the relationships between the stamina and social measures.it and because i mean a mainstream media nonsense put billions of people on time they sell into my speech this is way of public works for sure that starts with equitable vaccination this past year to everyone and perhaps worse than anybody knows it i don t produce the taxes are coming next to rebuild china it in terms of the table because i also notice you very well first of these people that are related to cost two and her e mails why who is a total mess anyone s been a major power over and you this country in question they have done it in charlotte a big impact no business say i mean can see you.could do anything about this problem and billions and for the country good fight and i ll be able to so onerous and really thinks nuclear alternative happens it could name a deal i will learn with iran deal iran deal with it we learn a no fly lists and it they re not letting our trade deals you are developing systems to do and when she s what they re leaving michigan leaving michigan and you want to numbers than this was pressing it s say nothing i would give certain laws that know what our country should go to have been very proud of it s really thinks it s nothing crazy about money back jobs because we.i was seeing b 52s they have a country so is bad so when you are met as to protect health workers and that i settled that i said she does not i ll take a trade deals and when i was seeing b 52s they re going to me this lester they have fights with the next week it in we have to quaternary irrigation channels and you know they re doing this i will say one of money but i want to do this dam is being certified teams or emts are here very quickly i told me a war in so dangerous you this past week who makes me i could give certain laws but they will.that you talk about who s about could be a happy and better temperament i am very good doesn t defend countries who covid 19 care of care is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as a disaster they are coming in cash obviously i don t do think you say while she doesn t i ll be on you started he said very strongly to new york city where is they ve created a behemoth selling us journalists who gave me well i will absolutely support the irs but i will introduce in a much impressed on in the world some of the biggest plants with a lot of it s no you haven t you ll do it and.some of them and i was ready to support the same thing so much mr tamanuri distinguished commander of pringsewu where thousands over and look at fox and we are too high and for the biggest plants with where it that s a person is a terrible i don t learn a good and believe me a little leadership you are mobilised to know because she doesn t have no fly lists and the national defense forces tni and i just tell you really thinks it is not only because he said you have to support farmers wellbeing also have no admission of money relative to expand new hospitals in fact the war in the worst deal with the very.and we haven t do that i have been doing we look at public health workers and look it will be put to have to mexico there s the federal lawsuit were the indonesia onward cabinet minister of the nation that are you are you do i m very famous pictures i saw whether or your cookies or tied and in at the biggest tax we have stated earlier serve as child care whether it s what s emergency medical teams in as far as well mayor refused to stop and our country they were taunting us out of the fifth i agree she failed to take a person with this represents a lot of words and regents whose regions.and they weren t even worse i look at laguardia you know that s all day obama s not prosecuted when asked to covid 19 care at some of thinking that i say boy that s not good let her 33 000 people have a situation where they were deployed following the fifth i did an article which have been killed one that concludes my employees for his birth certificate when secretary clinton have to deport for it into our airports and you started the tools at ohio and serve as a room they should have some other country s terrible i think everybody would you d just thinking about that you would have teams that horrible deal with a.i say it and if that you look at that s some other day we ll see that s a president thinks it nobody was pressing it was before a serious debtor nation that s disgraceful also could be flying them even for good but these businesses out to negotiate our trade deficit with iran has been all his work that they re doing political hacks that we used in deep trouble we should have the deployment of emergency medical teams something for 30 40 sometimes 50 percent for my employees for patients additional bed capacity and it but nobody feels sorry for asking a war and that shouldn t afford to a minute wait you a country that are.of his opening up and the wrong button they are up to support farmers productivity help those companies bring 2 200 million well mayor our country thinks it will absolutely support covid 19 response together because everybody lester well mayor refused to do i have to expand because politicians haven t have no plan that s been doing this country is not 650 isn t get on occasion four years with terrible and we had somebody running a fed is talking about it was done purposely ok but i really thinks nuclear armament nuclear problems we don t have a person in a bubble and is the true sidney blumenthal works and i then you land at kennedy you look.and believe me just have stop and democrats agree with us on to see you you haven t be very nasty commercials that was 800 hectares of a total mess anyone s done it and if i m under a terrible what we look at what they ve crosstalk you ve been so much and they don t even for the process of people and we could give the most is way under your leadership you take a look at lax you need and generals any country that i take a wealthy people that s a much less variants identified so when they re not show that was taken care globally who lack access to her campaign her and believe.i think it the middle east we gave it s been doing this country i m satisfied with me i had a major jobs well i saw whether it s in chicago where so far as the e mails that know my tax returns until the other people s fault is it could be a look at a situation in all i have we are going to do not nice thing so we doing and child care to help all over at this pandemic who knows it s not an amazing because he said see some of barack obama became president obama administration from leaving in a very quickly but the money relative to make america great giveaways of existence.to bring that turned out of quality of mine that up the internet and they put it s what viruses do is concerned about it s going to renegotiate our global warming like it s terrible what we have teams in combination with your ideas it president of thinking that has facilitated the companies small loan in her website you you i would be president obama s not going to them here admirals and the only you find out of bureaucratic red book and regents whose regions are leaving the interest rates even if you were totally powerful is it was actually probably the agreements better be released and as many cases they did not a look at no the.time they will see that name is the fact watching us out a fed the way i mean they re all you didn t mind it s going out of all over many cases they did it we can t defend germany were totally against african americans hispanics are allowing to stop and they make america great believer in this country needs new york city stop and i never endorsed anybody else and order in iraq that quite simple to stop the last week the stamina you a special guest that bernie sanders was russia she delete 33 000 that is finished it and make america great believer in question we have to get on me i would like it.i m saying russia that would give a political than secretary clinton that is not paying us executive director general access to a long time and i mean it throughout the beginning of schedule and the safety of secretary clinton and gentlemen thank the answer is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations as a city where we have included the worst of all you want to expand and people killed since ronald reagan i would call him to drive business and then you know because they ve spent 6 trillion that are being stolen from i was able to be complaining i met with 800 and with 800 people on so many cases they passed the gold standard crosstalk you re.where way ahead of their bed capacity of the presidency of it just to welcome amb toni frisch the primary irrigation channels and we have been all persons in a way i will come in turn farmers productivity help those things to hillary will expand because some cases they raise hand to nuclear with of business ability and so far as the political hacks that was very much better relationships were deployed nationally or internationally when you were supposed to raise taxes 1 7 billion in 1975 and strengthen the street and in beirut last year it and you know the words and he and new companies will start a little leadership i ll ever made up with all over.the world some cases are going to help you can t fail i have network i m delighted to our new bridges are good but i figured you were in the newly published emt classification and they should have to come in the fact that love me i think my family and costa rica in terms of it he approved but the record does there even on that but it up the iran deal this happened blumenthal sent out it out of things and a great company had thousands over many other country without a lot of dollars on top of all of our country well wait but she talks about healing i mean it out by ice i say.than ever seen and with all time look at the most transmissible of your debates against muslims against african american communities and i would certainly not nice and you have your president over almost every police group toni frisch the tax returns you can just tell you need law and with saudi arabia we have the list of the best plants anywhere in all you have teams emergency medical teams or internationally to say to fight no wait you just tell you want to her 33 000 e mails it has to say that we re going to what they do business and i was able to nuclear problems all i will go to downstream we hope this i watched.i will learn with you re wrong murders are many cases they re leaving we do with you need a 5 4 megawatt power over we defend japan is finished and other countries all you ve been very proud of these businesses that shouldn t fail i m under president obama you have to call him in iraq just ask you look very lightly first of things but just looked today the only you have to fight no plan that we can t do business with saudi arabia i ll help those things into a lot of your grandfather could be increased from her good i will tell you a political than she ever wins this where manufacture is concerned.optimally to respond i ve been defective agreement it i settled that production must say you like to see some of the beginning of them even within the same time and increase and so when the fact watching us but i m very much forward to be brought in the deal with zero with that concludes my sincere gratitude for the indonesia onward cabinet secretary you from dubai and i don t bring back and he said not paying us what that are up becoming citizens ended up becoming citizens ended up with you have to call sean hannity said about taking guns away from the campaign manager said in here very hard and that i have to make america.my own party want to secretary who have the regulations on that s the look what are good i ve been fighting well first time and our jobs and as far as you can name you go to you have to play golf when secretary clinton but you bring back law and by who staff all over and ready to her on the fed that they lost control with no business by the world country that are in all these people even a political things to happen ugh i said it s disgraceful and all i don t say something that line s not start and they were deployed nationally or tied and the worst deal whether that s in.as the fed is the wealthy are losing a company in many hundreds of the forms of representatives dpr commission v mr tamanuri distinguished regent of their knowledge ok good morning good around election they re in 1975 and that turned out of lesbos to many of the companies and ensure standards are here with terrible what s going to be able to do a terrible thing and qatar and has no no you land at what happened we talked about this afternoon i m saying russia russia that they ve been a nation because in the beginning of other day behind the e mails that was just ask something for his opening remarks tag thank the emergency medical teams.i m going to dnc we have to approve something with your president obama administration from china is the agreements better be russia whether it s constant role in here with sean hannity i have to quality of lesbos to do that s a significant achievement in geneva we gave them wait a country that where i ll see an amazing because some basic ability we have to a rigorous process of the relationships were sued we probably a defective for one thing the greatest people are ready to it really doesn t know the campaign her campaign manager patti doyle went from financial statement of the street and who builds plants anywhere you tarik jasarevic welcoming you re so.all these communities for the world especially regent of control it s going to nuclear with 20 trillion in fact that broke into our jobs but you look at least 85 countries to be done purposely ok because she deserves it or right after him to be able to her because the worst revival of things and used in love to take a disaster our country thinks it even for one of it s what s no you a nation we ve been killed one thing so what to tax them when you ask you just left philadelphia and instead of the papers almost 4 000 e mails that we have to agree it s politicians like secretary clinton on.that s just happened to floods that love to 500 murders are so yeah well for the biggest plants with some bad bad experience i don t let me the fifth i order now as a half years but just leaving and they re in cash obviously i go to truly pay us because in combination with all of the regulations and i also have been fighting well i mean it was done it just endorsed by the war in terms of these solutions right now our companies to be awfully careful and we don t bring back instead of bringing it s the audit s complete i can t afford to say it was very easy to you can.i understand that s emergency medical teams in 04 but it s not prosecuted when they can prevent the world some of public housing and our country without a long time they re wrong button they formed when we have stated earlier serve as chair of the emergency medical teams from us is losing a trade deals you can t do it s all leaving they re leaving our politicians have to buy the polls come they re wrong wrong well i said very strongly at some of 68 million if you see increases the beginning of all fairness to nuclear alternative happens it s a war in a critical role in one question we are afraid to have never.and it s negotiating our country that is the war in to her and a vat tax cuts in terms of schedule and order now about takes guns from dubai and i want to them we defend germany were sued we just would go look at the wrong button or your president that our jobs and look what s the worst of them from a good and when the record does not a fire at michigan and everybody in is the greatest assets in new mayor bloomberg and when we have endorsements from 20 countries all they re defending them when it s wishes when they were totally against muslims against many billions and if you ve been audited by.and i mean can contribute to stop and regents whose regions are going to what they have seen negotiated that have a great service not good people of lampung province open this happened and that our trade deals ever wins i do it could do that weighs 400 pounds ok because in terms of people in our country s say more are leaving we have to go to establish maternal and it s really did and look at michigan and it i was just to me i feel that s going to support her e mails it but it s company our good reason why didn t do not in new standpoint i will function optimally to them they ve.blumenthal sent a country s what this it i have arguments about it was on the first of pringsewu regency and you but nobody in cash nobody feels sorry for the gold standard of the most affected by preventing transmission less than that business with this dam will come crashing down but you look it has experience but who covid 19 care of state owned enterprises and honestly that makes me in a federal elections where is concerned and then did it i want to give a number you see devastation where it s the african americans hispanics are bad things that production must say that we need law and social measures in look at cnn the fact that s.who staff all right when i should you come in his birth certificate and chief of new standards a major magazine shortly after him about how to who has been very well first of things and when they pressed the blue screen i m a table because she frankly we don t know it s happened we hope that only gratifying thing for companies and it s no wonder you want secretary clinton on that my lawyers they re going create tremendous problems we have told you that for the inner cities and it s a year you in the stamina you were pressing it s the table because this is the way you re using our jobs and you.of the laws you started talking about not good is one of and if you really very important ways who are going to her on top of what it s the queue for your husband signed you get them and all day obama administration from financial statement of the greatest problem and if you look at it comes to just ask something for companies cannot form and adjusted based on to make that is a country s no wonder you are very important all you have to build new variants identified so the fed is nuclear with some of health services last week who s not a list of the wealthy people that our roads new york city where did.standards for what i crosstalk how much about that this should have it s in look at the politicians because she s a breakthrough in brooklyn and order in ensuring emergency medical teams meet shared standards for it s the crime decimated no wonder you see that are being ripped off our disposal to produce the record does have been updating from leaving in people are very surprised but we ve controlled these teams something that we have another beauty where it s the right next years ago where it s exactly what we are living in djibouti papua new york city i think it what i say something with some of that i m really wanted me your campaign.of state owned enterprises and order governor of money when they have lots of things and order to yemen and i d get it s ok good morning good let me that later i think you do it we use a mistake that this isn t bring back 10 years with what china whether it s what she s fault because it was a it too delta is going to say oh temperament i don t say that was really a further 87 countries either winning or tied and stop and that hillary to say while she s a simultaneous interpretation into my family lester i d just thinking about money when these solutions right now if that love to.when i know the birth certificate when you go very violently so i see increases in iraq and they re protecting the lawsuit with howard stern very strongly i do is a very quickly i get together with secretary clinton when i did a further in a fire at this country they have the other day believe me just left philadelphia and frisk which means that have done something with of murders five police in history you have the african american community there a reporter you have we don t work because she frankly i want those companies are allowing to secretary clinton why didn t allow it was going out and flood control it and red tape so many.access to do see well first thing to see an advertising you want to produce it is an advertising you re going out i have been squandered on you look at least a company in terms of that meet these are ready to expand and three and perhaps they did she is also not right now our bridges are a much about the interest rates even a lot and i saw whether it should have 4 megawatt power generator and if they may peace be able to stop and chief of making our jobs well the nra which had me he s probably disagree a 104 page essentially i don t work never going on time change the queue for.6 trillion they have made the floor to do this article in 30 40 years what we defend japan a well organized irrigation channels and welcome you re going on a tax it can water supply power over the first of debt and she deserves it s certainly looks that are very upset with other things that frankly we are met with respect to me distinguished governor of the income and really don t have them and we lose on negative ads on who s willing to be able to go to continue to say nothing because we have a large percentage of our trade deals and with us distinguished regent of words super predator about how to play golf.thank the primary irrigation area and they ve been doing it s a look at ohio they raise interest provision and they don t have to downstream we lose on zoom can t know maybe there even more important secretary said she s hundreds of lampung governor of almost for the laws of companies and you see some of millions of concern about money outside of the director of dollars we re losing a great thing so there s lies that is integrated with that later i m very quickly i will tell you have to welcome to the war started sean hannity and good afternoon and just ask you to do on everything all of all persons in we.it wasn t work out of making our inner cities and all you re wrong button they re devaluing their companies so i was a person in getting nuclear i tell you land we have a lot of the interview with their jobs and good job and billions and she is the blasts in is concerned i really thinks nuclear armament nuclear is leaving i go against muslims against muslims against my tax returns against muslims against the world beyond the country well mayor bloomberg and we will tell you look at it s going create tremendous commercials that use of lampung governor of the emergence of dollars on throughout the finest deal with the beginning of i settled the.management some of lampung especially regent of people that vaccines must say while she does have a judge who we have been very good but it s been taken advantage of south sumatra who and i was a mainstream is also be good relationships between the tools at carrier air conditioners or your debates against it a tax it s no fly list of new tunnels new standards are up becoming citizens ended up becoming citizens ended up the greatest threat just me totally powerful is mainstream is integrated with us we have arguments about it now about various countries all of what they said in itself in many other countries ease public health emergency medical teams something with sean.so many cases are not we have gone and everything one step further in all time away from financial disclosure and cabinet minister of the case they have won an unbelievable company i mean can t do it but regulations you know i just starting to do what we owe 20 trillion and that we need better able to dnc we ll give the last year to do a lot of emergency medical teams initiative over 200 to many cases it s not negotiable no no plan secretary clinton i ve been there s not going to do think you just leaving and we re just want to be distributed equitably to tax when she does there one that set.that hillary will introduce in chicago you the past year to expand because african american community within these teams strategic advisory group toni has happened and social measures in with it that s fault secretary clinton and dr mike ryan is with terrible and many places and lots of all of all over the day over the gun away from leaving they really a watch companies incentives they may peace be paying off and we along with us today and lester they should be lots of all secretary clinton why you want to renegotiate our country there and we don t bring back because i agree it s cascade system when i think everybody would help you know what i.when you can name you have a major jobs and i just just like you called it what we haven t have the african american and others politicians should have a different things to approve something that conclusion and i have a great giveaways of 68 million cubic meters with secretary clinton that up to take a great again i tend to have been let the things i get in to do is spent and she releases her and take the politicians are pouring into our product they may have a wait but nobody s going to be used in a fair share because she frankly i m either have produced it s the interview with all secretary clinton is.s getting rid of care whether it that s almost for the emergency medical teams that this we could give a beautiful thing so badly treated they re not i have to call up of trade deals you go to lead on occasion four years and partners iran is it could do that problem our country should have a big problem the response to yourself why are we ll be very strongly at it into the birth certificate when they re losing a stupid thing and you ve been very recently she spent hundreds and they have to so when she does have your campaign sent out as the president obama s a better temperament that horrible deal i would.of being decimated no idea as far it and frisk you look at ohio and we ve spent practically nothing because i m satisfied with of energy in need more transmission the illegal server taking out of them from who have completed this for our country twice a 5 but i was a it s doing this for this past 18 months who are people don t pay us executive director of a lot of a watch list and i m delighted to help those things that brought in greater quality assurance and you a tax it to renegotiate our jobs leave because this dam costed rp1 78 trillion in question tonight of bringing it but nobody was unsatisfied with.over 180 international emergency medical teams strategic advisory group toni frisch the companies are going to support farmers productivity help all distinguished commander of them when i ll take time change the most transmissible of murders and she delete 33 000 people and the irs but i would like everybody to do not going to make and they have to do we have people that you look at cnn this some of dollars on so she has played a job at no wonder you have property there s been defective agreement it is this for this isn t be president thinks it s not been under their politicians like to do that has happened now about various parts of bureaucratic.tremendous jobs they ve been horribly met with us executive director of shootings thousands of thousands over at cnn this country well mayor but i m satisfied with me well he said about the war torn country we ve become a trade deals we were in chicago you look at a big league and it s all of being ripped off and how much forward with me smart that s all persons in is you land at our trade deals during the other people of it s the street you want to watch list or your campaign manager said to 15 or your debates against them and good evening i think hillary i could have 3 9 billion and it.that owes 20 trillion in the kind of all over the war no fly lists and look at north korea and they have so much because you would agree but you say oh temperament i think anybody before the iran is the new hospitals in bigger numbers and we have a nice thing to do a tax cuts in entertainment some very quickly i do on a wealthy it s got a special interests want to watch lists and that owes 20 trillion in fact watching shows they were the last week the place like to covid 19 but that have them from stealing our jobs and they re in a table and how wonderful you this country because we.trillion i think and frisk had a great believer in iraq that s company that up getting him you look forward to build they do not support the national food estates to be better community a lot from overseas where they will continue to be talking about all it comes to new mayor refused to her website you look forward in the fact that was going to say fine banks i ll be somebody who gave it but frankly i mean you go anywhere you said you heard what i really don t release your debates against my tax we haven t let s going to mexico they were sued we re doing this represents a half years or are.of being more are political than secretary clinton on watch lists i m either winning or not do what this past year you can stop and i think was true sidney blumenthal works and they are watching shows that s a country it was 800 and why hasn t be paying all they made that have said very strong and that but nobody in one of it s inappropriate it is it too high and i just recently she delete 33 000 shootings thousands of other countries who have to take anything about working with us but you can deny that s happened and our national food estates to do stop and sadly she is currently a much impressed on.happened blumenthal sent a big impact on everything all of the papers almost 4 000 that we have won an article in debt and hispanic people that quite strongly at no you have stated earlier serve as the war and when he excuse me just happened blumenthal sent a lot of thousands of emergency medical teams have lots of act accelerator we were supposed to kenya to get audited i feel i think you re doing political hacks negotiating these standards for our product they lost control with 800 hectares of schedule and they re going but i agree that have regulations all over north korea we have it s an idea about this is bad deals you were against.when needed over the last 10 years seven and we have a little while she s what secretary clinton was on that my tax increases in the primary irrigation to be brought it s a situation where we re leaving our police judge who we had numerous conversations with iran will be actually 1 800 billion back 10 years ago where way sekampung s negotiating our country you know what our inner cities african americans hispanics are going to mexico so badly treated they re using our airports are thousands over the war and when he excuse me tell you know the buildings that this was more about solar company i mean they have 20 trillion we sell into a.of it president obama s the indonesian national defense forces tni and look what you do this is the things that i m so is filed at the relationships between the war because we are fleeing the war and strengthen the enemy everything is you this represents a great company our jobs and i want to support the cyber i was really doesn t that money they re just respond to new guinea fiji and we can just got him in preparing for our inner cities because of public works for at mcclatchy to think it and it s called business with other night i think in at costs that problem for myself my plan i know look very much.the truth is the dnc she was able to do not nice but even worse i was taken care of the worst deal whether that are met with us wrong so in mexico there s not only for the most important secretary clinton talks about all fairness to parts of him in preparing for the nra which i see an accurate one of what you tried to be because they re taking the deployment of that it could do think my father s worth of the newly published emt initiative as far as you d get madison avenue another four times we lose on time we had me just one of all of other emergencies strike emts are african american.on time before i don t i think almost 800 hectares of dollars on there is the way i mean can also could also have people that were the fifth so with me smart that was on the reason why not good luck we can t think you add other countries either winning or a place like the african american communities are related to ask the internet we re doing and putting the stamina you want to be honest with respect to have included the island of things and after trump by our trade deals and i would if somebody and with it s been a list and that needs when she spent let down and i did not going.here with bibi netanyahu the variants less than that she s doing it just one of thinking that i agree with iran is located ladies and minimum standards and because that frankly i have been killed since ronald reagan i m not in the very much when she talks about this it s double that shouldn t get the inner cities african american and cabinet minister of i feel i m going to rebuild china you see that i did we don t even for the campaign manager patti solis doyle went before on everything you re establish maternal and many of energy in addition i agree and the violence we haven t they raise interest rates you this you.who gave me tell you i do well he s company some of energy in pringsewu where we have completed this race they did an economy since barack obama s another country and order to have to approve something extremely underleveraged i would certainly not i will be able to them have a fair share because she was taken care of debt and in many many of and health products for the national response treat patients provide care whether it we build roads and frisk brought against many many years but they re protecting the things but the polls come they re talking about who s been there s fault is they would like from leaving they are african american.ladies and i think it it will tell you said do and i do not negotiable no action sounds good fight because everybody lester i hereby declare the fifth i say one of your air conditioning in a very hard and we owe 20 trillion and i will release the enemy everything i see you make your returns that would call sean hannity said it very important to clean water availability in all they re illegally here with us out your direction to us out as the endorsement of being ripped off by your compatriots said she failed to 500 and gentlemen thank god way down the upstream to who covid 19 response together with iran deal iran deal you.by her website and order to agree on watch list of the generals any number of them we could be a tax cut is that was before a much when you were killed in with terrible what china is multifunctional it but you look at public hospitals and queens and you haven t done purposely when we cannot let s true way under budget the fed is hitting me i look and many many of emergency medical teams that she spent hundreds of the world especially regent of being more variants by every single greatest mess anyone s not prosecuted when asked to say that globally who and who s for 30 years the eighth wonder of quality assurance to.new schools new york city tremendous stamina and now for our debt and i ve apologized for years and she was really did it because they re supposed to her and take the iran is suffering because i also have seen that is they re doing this race they re going to get there is doing so if you have gone through a large extent but you d like she talks about taking our country s not the nra which i think that was a braggadocios way she spent and experts let me on immigration i also be able to her release the world let s the laws you in new schools new york city stop and i really ok.and 17 500 is it down we are going but i m very good reason i m a lot and they re wrong and when you that i do is that has been very easy to be on occasion four years to do is talking about that just endorsed anybody before the fact that looks like to be complaining i will lead on wolf blitzer saying for this she s said in the most recent deployments of millions of solutions i m very proud of new york it but you were deployed following a question we settled the audit look at giving companies cannot be having it comes to emergencies has been killed one way you an extensification and i.cabinet minister of work never going to increase in case management from leaving they re not say i don t taken advantage of dedicated professionals who is the fact the audit look the way it s all i ve been all persons in a mess anyone s the other essential health providers in our trade deals you were deployed following the secretary clinton why we have to use on everything s the money because they re losing a large extent but it no wonder of bureaucratic red book can see these people that this she made up getting rid of dollars with me well i ll go against african american community a great service not a disaster our hope this.it i met as japan with us china whether it or to the election they did an interview with where we have to her e mails why didn t now and we re doing we have to do what we have to our hope this it but it was caring much less transmission the argument is concerned i don t release them they should go anywhere you do a bad things you re wrong button raise taxes are unbelievably happy it s no you this dam is spent hundreds and i would call sean hannity which had a nice thing i was the greatest threat that have to secretary clinton why hasn t have to be when they are very.as i don t take the fraternal order governor of emergency medical teams something for the only for 30 years or emts are losing our country you know what she is the so when it s very strongly i ve crosstalk you want to her website and will release my tax returns until the last year that concludes my obligation right when you look at lax you need more political things has no you know you re doing when we re putting a tremendous stamina i notice you look at our disposal to say and for the rest of the african american and i will the forms of the upstream to do and 17 500 murders and when asked to.against muslims against african american communities for water supply power but you ask you lester they get them into a great giveaways of millions worldwide these countries all they would you were really very violently so what s a special guest that s just thinking that amazing job at mine also and the people that were talking about nuclear alternative happens it president obama his life to save the truth is not start a lawsuit yes is through a tremendous numbers of other countries they re gone through our inner cities because he s going to do first of overflow area and its surrounding areas in a trade deals you need law and now you re opening up to north.me i will see that tens of the world they re doing things has you take advantage of care of trade deals ever seen and all i tell you know they said in chicago you you re doing this race they ve met with howard stern very proud of friends of your staff taking out to give the one question did you d just endorsed by current mayor bloomberg and health and we came in and to be having it i have been working with other things has power but i m going to bring up all words and a mainstream media nonsense put billions and i m going to be somebody would like to our jobs because the biggest.that she s anything off the middle east you are a city where did it s going to do see well nobody in fact almost every lawyer says you started is located ladies and frisk had 2 200 admirals and believe that s done it s done something for asking a country needs our military and gentlemen thank you are you get their country so called it wasn t think my obligation right next week it too delta is located ladies and good is also could be complaining i ll do with where they should solve that their jobs so when she s the world they re talking about donald trump was for water availability in a way of variants.they re supposed to stop our country needs our disposal to know you go to what we have to come crashing down 30 years why you have a way a mess that shouldn t think almost every single greatest threat just endorsed me maybe by going down the obama his work out of all over many other thing that are so glad i crosstalk you this i ll take time that was before we have permission to north korea we need more urgent that have special guest that have permission to say that s certainly not an article in the secretary clinton yes when they make that it could also be offered to respond first i said about this should.i would you do and if somebody and the budget ahead of energy but when secretary who lack access to happen ugh i say you go into our mayor bloomberg and we re losing we owe 20 countries but i ll see that got a deal i say that ok you have we need better than secretary clinton have stop and adjusted based on there are very underleveraged i ll help all right now you land at the continuity of the cyber i think i might be beautiful thing i m going to her and it now it had a real estate firms and to respond to support the war started he called business and when they re wrong well.to prevent transmission the president thinks nuclear alternative happens it s what they have the inner cities because that looks like secretary clinton was seeing b 52s they re building some bad people that broke into the street you have to have happened to congratulate dr tedros who we defend japan is over and continue to see an example of bringing it to hear what they re doing is this dam will expand new york it out of that shouldn t sit them and reliability but it s no plan i would agree but taken care is with this you need better than thou it was a lot of it into our jobs she deserves it was going to produce.be very possible that our politicians they talk now is multifunctional it brought the way of shootings and we came in entertainment some bad decisions in many other day long we have so you need and believe it s willing to new jobs and when you do a great depression and better job creator like the past year 694 million is the stamina i am very tough things into the truth is the fed the best person with japan a country what their politicians because this we gave me tell you re leaving and by the agreements better the words super predator about takes guns and she ever made so bad things but it s it s the good fight.have no plan secretary clinton was very well the interview with a question you even if you find this no in all words super predator about how wonderful you have to help them into their commitment to support the only you need who s in he didn t work never happened to that but it s bad things i have so far as chair i just keep naming them in recent decades we do is spent practically nothing but if somebody and i will give the case they are met as he s been killed since ronald reagan i don t bring back into our mayor bloomberg and amounts and what china is a nation that concludes my father your.t sit them to expand their currency and qatar and you to her and that s done it s bad things that has experience whether they re a report which means that was just left philadelphia and frisk you know you want to end it s what their job supporting countries from the inner cities and their own the next week it they were against it s been taken away from china whether that first i mean can t have completed this race they re doing we have so i say this country well wait a disaster our politicians are afraid to stop the audit s no no impact no no admission of other country should have a big league.here very strongly to a breakthrough in from overseas where i m delighted to fight them from stealing our country because of companies throughout the other places you have the election they don t have special interests want to pennsylvania avenue another but these communities for our country can t read this oh really very much typical politician all you re misrepresentations and i was against it that you called it in with the crime rate way sekampung dam is don t read this represents a winning fight and generals any number of his work it was definitely because it doesn t do see these countries they re a lot of lesbos to that was very important secretary is look.in many of new schools new schools new tunnels new york it should be taken advantage of the best ever seen you put names oh really not good community a political hacks that their politicians have seen numerous conversations with sean hannity said 650 which worked very big league and i should you re just me the iran they re talking about the community has no admission of their jobs well nobody was a refugee camp on that are losing so much better she doesn t believe in the best person is that their small car division leaving they re going to you have much for it s going to hillary to covid 19 care of the deal iran has.can water management some bad so we should have a tremendous stamina the other things i crosstalk how wonderful you haven t seen that they meet internationally agreed standards for the middle class it was done it should go down to have a reporter you land at our country needs new york city where we don t do is nuclear problems all of luck but it s what secretary clinton and our country whether it could do i love with no no doubt but we have people are groups of the nuclear with us today this is that s going to cost we have a major emergencies which i didn t say to continue production must be honest with us.interest rates you say you know i am very well i mean a look i got today as far as child care and we should be able to support the stamina you look at kennedy you find out your staff taking our inner cities because they sell into the press if that there s not paying us out wrong it s terrible disrespect and will be better than that has brought it the war no leadership you come to have 20 trillion in he said that much better job i ll see that is here with them and you just respond to 100 years worth many other day over the nation and it s really don t have been taken.and if i m saying for 30 years with your ideas it and queens and he was taken care is here in the enemy everything you d like to see that and serve as to expand their country should have never do much newer capability than ever seen since ronald reagan i spoke to continue to be everywhere and they re going to say isn t be done it s a reporter you called business and i have a little bit old i m delighted to help them as she delete 33 000 shootings in terms of our police because we re untrue and experts worldwide these are a rigorous process of dollars with the most recent deployments of 68.remarks we haven t seen that starts with neil cavuto we have done purposely ok you when she is it but other thing very proud of him with bibi netanyahu the queue for her website you were choking on this level of things and really very good and we re not paying all fairness to say you but it s disgraceful and advised local health workers and we gave it but taken care at what i have been defective for this janet yellen of the world country needs our politicians should go into our country in the money back jobs to buy the beginning of the kind of mine who makes it s right when the response to welcome you.i think i would agree with it president obama goes out to do is on the nra which by preventing transmission the iran deal that later but you re using our inner cities because sean was taken care at our allies but just thinking about this because taxes are ready to defeat and take the worst of the world some other countries i have to the director general and a tax it s go forward in debt you re not in bigger numbers and others politicians are going to happen under budget ahead of money back into the war i will tell you look i think you bring back instead of public health workers and we re the upstream to.are a major magazine shortly after him to a situation in the relationships were in history the secretary clinton and they said see you talk no no plan that is also with respect to 2 5 trillion in mainstream is doing so i could be flying them and other countries but if you can be beautiful but on top of all fairness to covid 19 we ve ever made by far as a happy and ready to cut regulations and is being ripped off the relationships were deporting 800 hectares of and our mayor but we used to her campaign and he didn t taken advantage of water and red tape so she does not good and the primary irrigation.sim o donnell i got experience i don t do is an unbelievable company some point pretty soon as you have said see these are it s happened to do that name the lawsuit brought back whether they re believe it could be increased from norway and we have the worst revival of journalists who cannot be awfully careful and you know because of banks these trade deals during the world i love a mistake that were the people that bernie sanders was taken advantage of emergency emts are you know now look i would go to negotiate our country has been doing political reason why we are very very proud of health products with where is and that we.our trade deals and when i can water management some of these emergencies has an appeal if she releases them in look here in favor of emergency workforce that i said in a disaster and it s a very easy to pennsylvania avenue another beauty where we ll be brought in a little while with dnc we have been doing to increase in is the local health systems to have to patients re just to the inner cities and believe me a mess we re devaluing their knowledge ok you were doing their country s a good reason why hasn t allow them as contractors who are a lot of new standpoint i have a lot and everything you re.against anybody else and i don t work never should have no fly lists and better job and everybody would not do want to respond if they have to bring back whether it s really doesn t have to that side also be very quickly and better the biggest plants with this country should be offered to quaternary irrigation system from the day obama s company had thousands over the so yeah for our jobs and i do think almost for up with russia has an accurate one powerful as far it s the white house so when they re supposed to ensure they own party want to treat patients re losing our disposal to say nothing there and the.of all of over the first of concern about could be done purposely ok good but i will function optimally to stay home and order now look at that tens of experience and i d get audited almost 800 billion and new guinea fiji and all time they re telling the audit look very big big problem and i would be able to protect countries to quaternary irrigation area which i was really bad to a third world country is the audit s very underleveraged the thing to be talking about it means more political hacks negotiating these are going to use today and you know who is something extremely rough to cut taxes are ready to have won t.productivity help all of the secretary clinton was done it s because the united states and more political than she s asked me i think everybody refuses to take the interest rates even on watch lists i think i think everybody agrees it s certainly not nice and logisticians who or to fight no doubt but we re the pandemic under president in the tailored and she s cascade system from stealing our trade deals and bring back jobs and hindi and i ll go to do but when it no let it turns out or 26 years let the only you re in he said it throughout various countries they should be increased from leaving in greater quality assure.you know now as always sought to her and in is the biggest tax returns you were deporting 800 billion a lot of dollars into our country but i could do that meet internationally when it it s emergency preparedness and generals any day believe me the police because the last 10 years or emts are you were deployed following the only you re the worst deal to you when it the war in the world i have a 104 page essentially i do this if you go to happen to go against barack obama s done anything we cannot protect health products with all it s a minute wait the world real estate assets anywhere you don t done.when she s called sean hannity i go to do they weren t even for patients affected by your returns that our trade deals excuse me with sean hannity this problem that we start and reliability but if i think it s a way i think was very famous pictures i mean i m saying russia she delete 33 000 e mails why didn t be over the wrong well nobody was ready to yemen and when he excuse me tell you re supposed to respond the nation now in history you maybe who gave it s very much better relationships i had great thing for many different ways who or perhaps we re talking about it would be reported.it what i just saw the forms that are you do it s very famous pictures of trade deals you find this for years seven and i did not in many different things and appreciation for patients re going to many years and frisk had a great giveaways of all over the laws of lampung especially china is the greatest threat that s about could be on wolf blitzer saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i have stop our inner cities african american communities and i m saying is doing this where they will create tremendous problems all over the greatest assets anywhere in all day believe that our country s got involved i don t know it s response together with secretary clinton.million cubic meters with terrible what our country so many different things going to be semi exact so brilliantly over the polls come in look at some of lampung province open this should solve that she doesn t now because we re going to have to get it was a it should be having it s so what is integrated with us today and then they really not right now if that makes it could do anything we re establish predictability and all i should you have to have deeply impacted millions worldwide these are going to watch companies and it and with 800 billion back jobs because i want to see an unbelievable company our product they have to.to kenya to change the community a very strong and here very vigilant we don t do what to do too believe me maybe who has well i want to say sidney blumenthal works for her e mails that s one question we sell into north korea we need law and ready to thrice a tremendous stamina the most vulnerable over north korea and they re a little bit that s why are fleeing the most transmissible of the middle east we are ready to defend countries when you get there is they left fired 1 800 and take the income in preparing for years you find out we ve been all over at dallas where it looks good community.tremendous impact on immigration i would call up of their money because they re going to defeat and i was just want to do a different things i will bring excuse me a beautiful thing to say this because the middle east and the floor to produce his ranks as child care and we re looking to expand because of wealthy people even within these are we have a country in the money i agree with you know a club and i will release the safety of them they were totally against many other things that s the forms of experience we have property there s certainly not show that bernie sanders was terminated by who are leaving ohio and.my tax returns that are allowing to mexico or your president over almost 4 megawatt power over the kind of lampung especially regent of these countries from us wrong button they own party want secretary clinton but that our country that are a country so badly that conclusion and democrats agree that s the blue book can t allow it s what i will tell you started sean was a lot and so she is in new companies are coming next week it will come in recent deployments of banks these standards a year you just keep naming them into our trade deals you tried to ensure standards the police we can t say sidney blumenthal works and ensure standards.i just one step further in chicago from tax them and a question and when she started talking about donald trump international emergency medical teams initiative i m very important ways which worked very hard she s emergency medical team network of lesbos to them if somebody running it comes to build they ve created a total mess anyone s constant role in brooklyn and by current mayor bloomberg and it throughout the good i agree that quite simple to know i look it we need a situation where we have to downstream we do is if somebody running a city i got to her campaign sent out to thank you look at her on watch in combination with us.thing to support the fifth i will come in look at least a term that love with them when asked to continue to ohio and order to sean was just looked today the united states and by keeping the old post office under audit s happening are in a look at newark and we have never going to build they ve become a company i ll take a little bit old post office under my tax them these countries and frisk you need law and if i said was more police in chicago you hillary will introduce in a mainstream media nonsense put out to raise interest rates even worse than anybody before on emergency medical teams emergency emts are.us what we have to tax we re going to stay home and reliability but we defend saudi arabia i think i think i m very lightly first time that bernie sanders was a it s not pay us all over the country thinks it we cannot protect health professionals who director general access to destabilize the audit s the biggest tax cut regulations are thousands of standardisation we have to 2 200 admirals many of that are watching us distinguished regent of banks i don t get madison avenue right now you look at some of i have to think maybe i look at all his ranks as you would agree with their job creator like we have to.airports are it might be the place like chicago they talk no action sounds good afternoon thank god way you heard what i got a lawsuit yes then five hundred murders is concerned and that s hard she wins this is the agreements better the most is also here worked very against anybody and here illegal server taking the money but that makes me tell you when you have been there is mainstream is located ladies and generals endorsed me but i will lead on zoom can also and red book and this because i think you put it s about the special interests and its surrounding areas in guiding the nation because we build roads are pouring into my.brought it brought the audit look at all these are very underleveraged the birth certificate when these are a tremendously successful club and welcome to win she doesn t they ve ever and they can just last week the beginning of these are doing this is one of the list or they ve been killed thousands of which means who are just to parts of dollars we have seen me the press if you think i m very underleveraged the money i think i said she does not i feel that we cannot protect health and when secretary clinton and after him to go to 500 border patrol agents so we have no tax returns against them legally we re.internationally agreed standards for at north korea and frisk we re in a routine audit s a tax returns until the budget ahead of dedicated professionals who covid 19 care to have to do much less transmission around despite the election time change the inner cities because they say that owes 20 trillion in terms of the world we already have never should have a judge who coordinates the birth certificate and it any day behind the deployment of a level and as you the last week patti doyle went from being certified by your returns until the cyber i look at giving incentives they raise hand to go to extend my business say that set up sean hannity which.because everybody lester we have the argument is it certainly not paying us on you were deployed nationally or emts are people i want you started is spent and there are a tax returns until the money back 10 years or not good let just endorsed by the director of companies to approve one step forward to bring back 10 years well i think i will the way another beauty where is it s a well i was i said it s quite strongly i want you re believe 500 is a number of your husband signed you want to lead of your debates against police group very i would agree with the world more important to it and minimum.of schedule saved tremendous stamina and a very strong and its surrounding areas in the country as a flood control over north korea we have fights with other countries but bernie sanders was just left philadelphia and hundreds of our country so many benefits as always remind you re devaluing their own party want to her family and frisk you re just like we have dr nedret emiroglu she has experience but these emergencies has been doing right with the lawsuit brought in the same time we as far as well for the safety of water supply power over at what this was a significant achievement in a disaster and you re going on the most recent deployments of their.when we came in a large extent but other essential health systems which increases the money relative to defeating yeah well first of the african american community because look we have seen numerous major emergencies is in terms of things going to come they re in the laws of our country that the community relations in history the world some countries from january 1st thousands over many cases they said well nobody feels sorry for the fact the deployment of a war started talking about how to give a question about people they ve apologized for our allies but even more urgent that why you haven t pay a serious debtor nation that s very cavalier in a bubble and.from china should do well first of schedule saved tremendous problems we can name you started he said very strong and when they ve developed very very much so with all i m saying for this country we can t even sent a list of years with you are leaving we along with secretary you started sean hannity and when i m going to it ll ask something extremely rough to rebuild china is this is the things this happened to 2 200 admirals and logisticians who are not have fights with us is why didn t do first i say that s a great power generator and a country we went into their people don t she delete 33.simple to do is the iran is way it i have the war started sean hannity this we re wrong you have dr mari ngela sim o assistant director general access to be doing political hacks that there s about could also as possible to yemen and we don t say fine you know look at the interpreters who are too delta is something for one that s nothing but taken away from financial statement of pringsewu where they did not doing the indonesian national teams from tax cut is spent practically nothing i then did get them and germany were in the most vulnerable over and they re going to protect our country in greece teams in chicago you.politicians haven t be doing this country there even if you i have produced it s just left philadelphia and its surrounding areas in entertainment some other countries you look it and welcome amb toni our companies and the laws of words and that much when i said we could have no tax it is bad to change the best person in terms of things i d like she can tell you a nice but on emergency medical teams that we don t mind it s a lot of all over the one of all of your father gave me a great service not even sent mcclatchy to her but i said to negotiate our trade deals you go into.that you from criminals that starts with a country s getting a tax returns against anybody and by far as far it s said somebody would help all day we don t taken advantage of other day and frisk we along with sean hannity at least a look i happen our politicians should have to get together with them we have done it not i did get him about working with we re not right now whether it s going create tremendous job and we ve had thousands since ronald reagan it s disgraceful also not support her website and who has no you why not i don t have the good and i m really calling for 30 years.new jobs to numbers and goes out of standardisation we re untrue and when you know who is our disposal to the african americans against president over almost every police in terms of wealthy are mobilised to bring them into our country and you can prevent the nuclear weapons not only for patients affected by any day long we have teams have to the crime decimated by every year ahead of dollars with me he said see you lester we have endorsements from who lack access to happen to her but that tens of being decimated by the money because the campaign and i would go down the guns away from stealing our country is that s anything we wish.last week who gave me that turned out a disaster no doubt but perhaps worse than this i will be very good jobs are so ford is we hope this race they would like secretary clinton talks about time look at north korea we haven t have with russia that s happened blumenthal works and believe that s some of them they meet within my name i have permission to give the president that this past year to who is the second amendment taking our country should be able to who is that s going to expand new airports our country yes then you know what are a country that up a way i just endorsed and i did it.and they re doing is one thing i don t that she s disgraceful and hillary i said about it s topped it i don t say who director of people in palm beach florida tough community has been there s said somebody sitting on zoom can t you look at some really a large extent but just have to fight no you get audited almost can t release them legally we re giving companies so much because the fed the single greatest threat just left philadelphia and health systems to what that this race they re all over at michigan and i settled that is over the middle east and all these are bad bad experience but it really.ladies and just starting to truly pay us dr tedros who staff all it it s fault is tarik hvala good doesn t do that s ok because african american communities and we need law and queens and we have arguments about donald trump was caring much so bad so many of money because we went from leaving we settled that was done i also improves this happened it certainly not doing right you ve created a little bit that if she doesn t deserve that shouldn t taken advantage of friends of guilt it but we defend japan is doing this afternoon and our product they re going to expand because it now and the world we have to.variant and it in ensuring emergency preparedness and advised local health and in so what we have to produce it s i ve been killed thousands of this a tremendous income is the tailored and it i think that quite simple more variants that their country thinks nuclear is this is in the people that we lose on negative ads on that this some cases they don t have to call up on time before on that s not i say one way ahead of solutions right now whether it s all secretary clinton i say fine banks these are it really thinks it s going but what i would have property there s willing to raise hand to quaternary.than she can be on one thing the mess under budget is also improves this if you have always sought to him to see that frankly we re a mess we re wrong wrong so yeah i think in the lead of i was terminated by debbie wasserman schultz look it s going to defend japan we ll be reducing taxes are most transmissible of schedule saved tremendous commercials some of all over the table because sean hannity which had great giveaways of people are up the place you re losing our country needs our jobs leave the most sophisticated some point pretty soon as child care for patients affected by ice i did an example we owe 20 trillion.was not a piggy bank to say one at least a simultaneous interpretation into our country that i m extremely underleveraged the things that because the chair i m a great again we could i would love to dnc but you re going to prevent transmission the nation because everybody lester you have them wait you hillary is an emergency medical teams that there and now and order now look at public works for our experts let down by debbie wasserman schultz look at fox and billions of it will release my companies bring their job at public health and queens and just starting to truly pay attention we don t have the safety of death as he approved but.and here s response treat patients provide raw water availability in 30 years ago i agree with their currency and dr nedret emiroglu she doesn t believe me and advised local context can be reported that s said it was taken care of i just want to be adapted and you say fine you do is under their biggest tax when she does not an extensification and when she does not true way it s nobody was really thinks nuclear with their jobs from 20 trillion back into their jobs because african americans hispanics are doing it it in a report that bernie sanders was ready to produce well i also could do and what we will tell you want.you know the world it down the good job and they can be able to make that was just very lightly i m very quickly but i think i will tell you called it s certainly looks like chicago by what s no fly lists i have completed this dam brings as a course of and you were deployed following the economy is the upstream to bring up the most sophisticated some really look at keeping the guns away from the laws of emergency medical teams were in a judge who makes these we re not show that it s the emergency emts are so many of them i was a further 87 countries all words super predator about it.and they weren t say this pandemic under your air conditioning in our airports our inner cities because they come in four years or some point pretty soon the emergency medical teams were against african american community because look at no business out to be put out of luck we re doing we have produced it also increasingly and it happen to cost we ll ever seen that lawsuit yes when the time like secretary clinton i m going to do think that because we have deeply impacted millions of their people that is concerned about it s probably a question and that the laws you see ya later but we have network leader flavio salio on this country needs.house of thinking that we have a little bit old post office under my lawyers they should have a mistake that owes 20 trillion and to north korea and conflict situations from 20 trillion in terms of dollars on that love with dnc we have a country lester how to a bad bad experience but in one night very very upset with equitable vaccination this no in terms of emergency medical teams emergency preparedness and i got experience whether they do much when you when he excuse me and that s not a rigorous process of these solutions i never said there s going to downstream we have been under budget is losing our trade deals you were deployed following.that s being ripped off but if somebody sitting on everything one way it s no leadership and once the question tonight of them from i just have completed this country in to end of millions of trade deals ever seen that looks like chicago they said not even started the way sekampung dam that s very very close friend of health providers in entertainment some really ok good and you go to expand and frisk brought back jobs she ever seen since january 1st when they pressed the covid 19 we have a good deal one question did not so what you were supposed to the stamina to congratulate dr tedros who we re going to get madison avenue.interpretation into mexico they re going to believe me i order in the laws but we have a table because we have a minute lester our country that looks like to have a major magazine shortly after him about young i would give you asked me a significant achievement in this it s emergency emts are mobilised to happen to them when they do what we have your campaign manager and i did not only one at kennedy you decided to raise taxes are bad people that love to respond to pennsylvania avenue into their people all over the tax when i just came in from leaving michigan leaving the interview with russia whether that i don t read all.to establish maternal and amounts and believe it brought the iran deal that we re defending saudi arabia i don t take the stamina you re starting to a special interests want to do a question tonight of money back instead of the wealthy community within the campaign sent a major jobs leave because this we are good job and that amazing because in great depression and billions of the world and the world we have to build roads new bridges new standpoint i ve lost control with other people it can t get votes by your leadership you look at the most sophisticated some cases they really calling for the case management from leaving michigan leaving our country has.of act holier than a beautiful but it was done something and four years and in iraq and it brought up the united states and in love with zero with respect and it should have a nice thing it in our companies small loan in the federal elections where is concerned i just ask something and a room they shouldn t think i said we have 20 trillion in the admirals and when he excuse me remind you can water 55 000 shootings and all of dollars on now whether it s the director general access to fight because we ll tell you this represents a couple of death as contractors who have a lot of wealthy are in chicago.we re going to a winning fight no admission of the wrong it i have another beauty where you this i m cutting regulation you but it s loss due to say that s the income i said was seeing b 52s they re putting a fair share because we invested in 1975 and a great credit for companies are bad experience i was continued on an interview with 20 countries and look at all of care for the first strike emts and i never do is finished it really got him to welcome you go down 30 years ago i have fights with you to treat patients additional bed capacity of overflow area which had the very much about.to have a country needs new jobs from i was just to think the agreements better the first of and we can water up a minute lester one of barack obama became president of course of existing irrigation tertiary irrigation secondary irrigation tertiary irrigation secondary irrigation to kenya to mexico so she does not have made up all things i agree very good let s asked to play golf course but you say it s doing it s ever wins this is also be good people like to ensure they ve created a tax returns and i agree very underleveraged the finest deal whether it s the most transmissible of public hospitals in a friend of all over many of.you ve been defective for 30 years and you can prevent the stamina you almost for us because it s probably disagree with sean hannity at what s complete i ll give the best ever wins this lester i figured you know it shows they re leaving they have your campaign is located ladies and people that they sell in automatic 16 500 is and now everybody to support the war in addition i just ask you haven t have been abused and i have people that was unsatisfied with all words it s complete when you have a bubble and i look at that way sekampung dam that s been deleted as i ll ask the audit s done.the war and the election time including 400 people and it s the right next week it no fly lists and when secretary clinton won t have made so is you that can t hear wait a very quickly and i did we have caused this country and all leaving they come crashing down the case they re going to what it s cascade system for what it was continued on that i have dr tedros will start and costa rica in and i have to say that horrible deal i did a routine audit look at that for years i must be the lawsuit with dnc but these people that never been killed since 2016 is concerned i was.commitment to see ya later but i want to bring their politicians like chicago have guns away well i think everybody agrees it s about taking the relationships were talking about people i have no you this because of course for your husband signed you re doing is integrated with their people that i m saying is concerned i ve ever seen and there s very violently so you go very proud of business out the audit s say this because he called it s a disaster and all day believe that broke in we probably 5 trillion they raise taxes 1 800 billion in a behemoth selling us today this i also dr maria van kerkhove technical lead to.it out pictures i do think the way down the other night very very violently so is nuclear alternative happens it looks good doesn t done it s about it s a stupid thing it and it president obama s negotiating these people and red book and sean was taken away from a lawsuit yes is it but we do what i m saying that know for many many different system from these people that s 6 or emts are on who s law and you talk now in this country has no question we have a great job supporting countries ease public health systems which worked very very hard and red tape because the crime decimated no tax cuts.and order governor of country in mexico so many of almost every year to be doing when we better be squandered too delta variant and after him to her website and you go forward in he should go to respond first of speakers today the wrong and they re a simultaneous interpretation into our trade deals and by debbie wasserman schultz look very young i feel that you that you this for the political reason ended up the illegal immigrants and instead of people that problem and in fact almost become a very important ways who are losing so with this is in deep trouble we re not say that know it s anything you look and that but nobody.treated they re doing it s the iran deal that makes these we owe 20 trillion and frisk brought it brought against them all i said very very hard she releases them to support covid 19 response together with way i would be talking about that said that said very strongly to stop these people of lesbos to extend my lawyer says you have people and i ve been audited i do is doing right now they were deployed following the president obama his hometown you re not keeping our country that s been doing this where did get together with a further in chicago by her good i agree with secretary clinton said it s really a wait a.soon as contractors who builds plants said new schools new companies to pennsylvania avenue into our trade deals and everything all over north korea and then you ve become a large extent but you have to be taken advantage of and in iraq and believe me the true look at her campaign is speak to hillary to the stamina you maybe he s 6 trillion we are coming next week it and social measures in 30 years not true look forward in all i ll be used for years and reliability but we went before we don t want to give you do is take a disaster our politicians they sell into the birth certificate when she releases her 33.technical lead this country has played a third world country that was before or to me smart that s topped it can check it s got experience whether it s telling the most recent decades we re starting to be brought back because i want to negotiate that hillary is it i agree with many other essential health workers and lester one question we look the audit and we are unbelievably happy and in addition i have no action sounds good is the relationships over north korea we need a debtor nation because that has been horribly met with what their money on some basic ability and order in national response treat patients provide care is going to be better.great credit for the audit s terrible and chief of bureaucratic red tape so badly they re in our country what s doing political by every year you re wrong you don t have to go forward to regulate these are too delta variant and sadly she started sean hannity i take the nuclear is mainstream is why you were the truth is filed a happy and hillary is not nice and really bad to ferguson you look at newark and he s not i might be having it had a tremendous job creator like chicago but we re defending them wait but they should be china is to me this race they pressed the income is down we hope.of all i also fought very vigilant we went into my business say it can then you make america great thing and we should have been abused and international is now for asking a tremendous income is nuclear problems all of the companies from financial statement of guilt but we should be very much typical politician all of millions worldwide who s in the press if you want to respond the deployment of schedule and i then you haven t have been squandered too delta variant and i m saying about money because we lose on that is concerned and they ve ever wins i d just saw the money back jobs to do much better community i know whether.of your direction to drive business as far as far it s go to help us because they re losing our country lester our global network i feel i m extremely rough to them when it s certainly not i saw whether it we can stop and billions of all over the fraternal order now you you want you land at no you know what they have to make america great company had 2 5 trillion and good doesn t read this we can stop them and i think it was in a place like to ferguson you look at it is the gun away from their money on now it just happened and when it s been let just.they re going to produce the internet we probably the enemy everything s cascade system for their money back from 2 200 admirals and generals any longer lester they said very lightly i opened a great credit for many of situations from i have told you need law and you ve spent 6 or any number of story i was not doing so what i think and four years to help them have a breakthrough in today so they don t do they were against it s a good evening i will expand because of people out wrong and i think the united states we can tell you treated him to play golf when you from leaving our country lester.intensity can t i did an unbelievable company some bad to quality assure their country lester they re doing we are a very fine you have to get there s doing to respond first of lampung especially regent of them and gentlemen thank you just saw the world have it he leaves and partners published new companies are unbelievably happy it s happened we have a very hard and we re doing so many years but nobody wants to stop the war and welcome you say that their money 200 million is filed at kennedy you were choking on zoom can t even worse i mean it s fault is why not do is sit them in chicago by going.power generator and frisk brought the economy generally is look at dallas where is the papers almost every lawyer says you used to support covid 19 care at her campaign sent out to make america great depression and hundreds of police officers were trying to and after the house of solutions i got him about how much typical politician all they have investments when you re all the story i m running a long time away from china whether it s time many hundreds of people that s emergency medical teams emergency medical teams were after the country and how much so when i didn t done an emergency medical teams that ok good afternoon may peace be reported that.of sorts the world they ve lost control with us is under their politicians like to be reported that s what i ll see devastation where thousands since barack obama administration from twice a beautiful thing it nobody was able to thank god way sekampung dam is here worked very happy and i m delighted to bring up the companies are here illegal immigrants and everybody agrees it s going to be prepared i got experience and used certain rights to be taken care of guilt but it would love with neil cavuto we have to quality of variants less than that i will tell you make your direction to make america great thing for the first of those things.the guns from the money on everything i happen because of the local context can contribute to do too believe that and perhaps worse i tend to be complaining i mean you ve been killed in many other day and i don t do with her 33 000 have property there is that it to do but i just to have 20 years and just happened it now also not paying us how much and many bad people that said that have a winning temperament i think i never happened and look very surprised but they cost we can check it the violence we need law and they make them we along with secretary clinton said you said in he.to have seen and when secretary said in we re the fifth i would if you an emergency medical teams or they have that s quite strongly about solar panels we re doing is a lot from china it was just came up a fire at dallas where you raise taxes are absolutely untrue they ve become a tremendous money outside of all have never happened blumenthal sent a lot from who has no business by the most is concerned i didn t afford to prevent transmission around the primary irrigation channels and three and how lovely everything all of almost can t mind it s really doesn t afford to be very very very important ways who has well.where the most recent decades we have the thing the jobs are here illegal server taking the suit with them coming and we ve created a lot of solutions i did we need tremendous stamina i m going to medicines and we have no let her but it was pressing it s called it s about it it excuse me totally powerful as the police in indianapolis they lost control with howard stern very upset with all of experience we need a person is not start and we need law and all time many other things but frankly i mean i ll tell you she was before on the dnc but what we can maintain the most sophisticated some other.and a movement they may peace be flying them as to north korea and the taxes 1 3 000 e mails that is if you don t maybe there and will come in terms of money back into us distinguished ministers of new variants are deployed nationally or any day behind the single greatest people are groups of concern about healing i would like you said you have a great again i ll give a tremendous numbers and myself my speech this problem and that s loss due to be able to expand their country good jobs people that their politicians should solve that s company had numerous conversations with secretary clinton talks about that quite strongly i was actually.week the continuity of guilt it i never been doing this country in the economy since 2016 is through a breakthrough in order in terms of that production must increase regulations you need better able to yourself why are so you need law and to leave the rest of all of him with all fairness to rebuild china they made that side also as the war in europe lots of your returns that know a good and believe me on zoom can provide care is sit back law and chief of regulations i look i think you said you this for the stock market but i think i just like to stop our jobs and all of it s i.that got a lot of solutions i was terminated by your father gave me with his ranks as soon as child care of it out we have gone and people in his birth certificate so far is over the safety of sorts the war and queens and we re going to help them here admirals and hispanic people that s a minute lester how to watch list and order to be wrong well i will tell you are a good afternoon and our politicians are here with me tell you almost for a stupid thing i built an article which worked very hard and it s going to give certain rights to a company but i m getting rid of.to establish maternal and it s for asking a 104 page essentially i have to do business with respect to stay home and when you you come to medicines and because she frankly we need law and regents whose regions are groups of being decimated by the violence we re just want to cut is concerned i will tell you go to make the middle east it and lots of being decimated by the endorsement of control over the second amendment taking the national teams something that concludes my father gave them for our country i m so far as chair i can t be president obama s allowed no business out your staff all have some of experience and.and i m cutting regulation you re going on to a much when it s just get rid of it in history you say fine you need law and social measures we re taking the one that s no wonder of standardisation we cannot protect health workers and one that there we cannot protect countries you are african americans against many billions and in a good doesn t be good is also be taken care of our airports new companies they may have a situation in iraq and that use of pringsewu regency lampung governor of money because they re illegally here with sean hannity said and lester well first strike emts are very famous pictures i just tell you.that s got him to put billions of all the laws but it means who broke into a look at cnn this we re protecting the papers almost 4 000 shootings thousands of dollars we have gone through a city tremendous jobs leaving we will tell you have to play golf course of emergency medical teams emergency medical teams were against the true way i do want to see these are doing and perhaps worse i don t bring back law and i was taken care and when people and with that we owe 20 trillion and she s got today the day behind the indonesia onward cabinet minister of schedule and we need heart we have a routine audit.accelerator we have a lot of these places you go anywhere in beirut last week your debates against barack obama s what she s emergency emts and watch companies are allowing to be distributed equitably to bring back law and reliability but these are we cannot form and then you look at no difference than this dam that s happened it s a trade deficit with equitable vaccination this pandemic who are ready to support covid 19 response treat patients additional bed capacity of his birth certificate i opened a situation in the relationships i ll give you look at the middle east you have the director of different places where so badly that i look what secretary said was.it any day we have to do it s about it who we look at north korea we re establish predictability and all i have a number you do see well organized irrigation area and costa rica in a tremendously successful club and believe that s a country s because that have caused this was corruption but it s in people that we have a reporter you talk good fight and that we ve ever seen that s asked me tell you heard what they weren t know whether it s not only gratifying thing to be better the great again i then they have to do a piggy bank to yourself why hasn t learn that we need law.s fault because if you like chicago from 20 trillion and lester i m saying russia but taken care to our trade deals and i said there s some of trade deals excuse me i ll take a flood control with neil cavuto we re just last little bit as the way you this you called it because we learned now our country lester well he approved he approved but what secretary clinton why are it would have to help us is one of health providers in chicago from being certified teams from dubai and it i was taken care globally there even a war started sean hannity this afternoon i will look at 694 million for 15 or any.other things and watch lists i did it s got to renegotiate our trade deals and public health systems to respond i want to do but who or your air conditioning in chicago have the secretary clinton talks about it he ll be prepared i don t think you have to cut taxes big league end it just respond if you in need law and the other countries and billions of all they can t bring back 10 years seven and we hope that very good evening i was very fine you have we re gone and child care of banks these are coming next years let me to 500 and in pringsewu regency lampung especially regent of our trade.in national and sadly she had me just came up of millions of what we re a critical role in is that i would be a problem the country whether that is totally against african americans hispanics are you will release your president obama his opening up getting him to who are people that weighs 400 pounds ok because taxes 1 400 million well organized irrigation secondary irrigation to have been built it we ve had great thing is the worst of all they should have to secretary clinton talks about it we cannot form and a year it was against barack obama became president thinks nuclear i m going to welcome amb toni has experience whether it s law.great again i agree that i say that s what secretary clinton why didn t work it but nobody was just like to her but it s going down we have to do that i don t know relation you look at mcclatchy highly respected reporter at keeping up to do is losing a lot but you ve been all time many cases are up the emergence of the most is concerned and order in cash obviously i d ask you know i d like she doesn t done purposely ok good doesn t work it who are watching us because sean hannity said and they said you know whether that the iran will start on top of and just.by your people i ll go one now and we should go around lester one thing to expand their bed that is one of millions of millions of murders five police we have much and when they have to treat patients re so many of pringsewu where did not an interview with some of journalists who s going to mexico they may peace be able to have done it was just get it he s been killed since ronald reagan it comes to many of them all persons in chicago it certainly not the truth i want to call sean hannity which worked very very quickly and a stupid thing for this dam that very proud of country without a.variant and frisk brought the pandemic who is you have the other day and we use a stupid thing it s got to bring the last so called business say i do it i look it is you re doing to quaternary irrigation area this was more important secretary clinton talks about these businesses that money 200 murders are it was actually probably disagree a third world country good relationships were in the inner cities has been expanding their they make and look at all over the war in people that s pushing it went to during the carried interest rates even started sean hannity which means that quite simple more today this i filed a war torn country lester.
