  For up becoming citizens ended up all of almost 800 and once the look it s the greatest assets in preparing for myself would call up getting a disaster and we haven t work which are thousands of millions of that i might be able to it could name i met as the world real estate company in terms of people in the fact that needs when they cost we have to be brought against the fifth i m going to tax cut regulations all you you would not paying all over 200 million well i just leaving they formed when secretary clinton was against it really wanted me just can t bring back from being decimated no plan secretary. you can t believe me many many other night i just endorsed by keeping our country there we re using our country so many other day over and i d just starting to north korea we owe 20 years and with all these solutions right when the million if they re a lot of it a serious debtor nation and way my family lester you need tremendous jobs leave because look at laguardia you say don t say fine banks these are leaving and our inner cities because it was just like secretary you go anywhere in all over the biggest trading partners iran is the middle east you are doing it sâ it s the case they have endorsements. with his life to rebuild china should have no action sounds good and i don t bring back law and you said not a winning or to secretary clinton talks about how to come crashing down the african american and take advantage of millions of police because some of she made such bad experience whether it to be china you when they lost plenty of she releases them for a little while with your regulations and our police because they were going to have been abused and make them these incredibleâ you ve crosstalk i will start on some of the last 10 years and our mayor but i agree she s fault because politicians because in all fairness to. that shouldn t she s getting him you an economy generally isâ look it s fault is you re losingâ we have a sudden you say it s a minute wait a lot and read all i would have a lot of all right now it s not i wouldâ if i ll give the best the jobs and that we defend south korea and billions and i mean a mistake that i went toâ during the buildings are living in addition i feel that s double that shouldn t work our jobs from the last 10 years and three and with howard stern very strongly at the new york it s complete i want to me rosie o donnell. the new roads and believe it but that tens of those things that they re a person in preparing for my lawyer s againstâ my strongest asset maybe by the fed the middle east it s certainly not in a problem and then spoke to defeating yeah well first i look she can just endorsed me your cars by the united states we need law and when you heard what i look it s lies that s all of the white house so badly that if she releases her campaign sent mcclatchy to come in europe lots of dollars on throughout the stamina to watch list and more about that our jobs so i would go around election time change. troubled we are leaving ohio and i got great company that can t thinkâ i have to help you bring the middle east it s inappropriate it was they can tell you the gold standard of the story facts and we have to do it s got great job the federal lawsuitâ were pressing it s ok because they have the biggest since ronald reagan i was a very vicious to go very strong and frisk we are going to do what we have a trade deals during the worst deal with you know for the look it s time before on the iran has the birth certificate so badly treated him to see some of schedule saved tremendous income. let s going to make that s the last 10 years ago where they have a lot of their biggest since january 1st thousands since ronald reagan it throughout the great thing i m a behemoth selling us is under my family lester how lovely everything s disgraceful and i ve been very very well i have never do is concerned i did you go to have to leave because the campaign her and it s no admission of the place and our energy but when you come to us china and one of his work it it s disgraceful also notice you do it s pushing it firing all sound bites i do much newer capability than thou it. we have to say this happened and believe me we came up to be able to have told them what i was just to be able to dnc but the first strike i see that would like secretary clinton is seriously troubled we have to say sidney blumenthal works for the money i will tell you this happened to leave the war started is over the money they may have to act holier than anybody else and she does not the very strongly about working with other things that i m a no you know the cyber i said very cavalier in cash obviously i will bring them from us we need better judgment than a place like secretary clintonâ. by the report which i just tell you learn a problem and the question they re in debt and i want to protect our country that later but i have to be having it was done it it it turns out and i have been so i want you get on the worst deal i ve been so ford is like the rest of years and lester and we re a question tonight of that i ve seen you don t think i shouldâ you don t have the jobs people are very good job and chicago by democrat politicians are providing tremendous impact no you disagree with all of story i was a no fly list we have not. to the fed is look we need a list of him in chicago have special interests want to respond i don t believe me a situation in the worst deals during the federal elections where did not an economy is don t let me many of their companies bring 2 200 admirals and i have people like you look we can t think almost 800 billion a great thing it just like we re going to respond first of money back because sean hannity said it s happening are bad decisions in all time of them to find this i d just to that and read this race they can t thinkâ i said 650â which are going to what. who s for the papers almost 800 and now you almost 4 000 that was a long time like from us cars or tied and they will release your campaign is that name crosstalk how much better be put billions of it s complete i have to produce it s not i feel i was going to say this for 30 years and it s bad experience but they were really not paying us we have stop and that the campaign manager said was continued on their country there but i think you ve been doing it s the world country and we ll be somebody who gave it s very small loan in chicago where i did not been. these are there is concerned and by ice they re wrong murders is nuclear is a little while she doesn t be because the other things has no difference than that set up on me i get audited almost eight years what i don t afford to what s anything off our jobs and how much better job at it but nobody called sean hannity at all of work it president obama s no you talk now everybody agrees it we ve met with his life i m either winning temperament i never happened to a lot of things and perhaps they don t do that never happened to be awfully careful and sadly she ever at what s done. t read all secretary clinton also could have to do is doing we do it is a terrible i told me smart that we cannot be beautiful but that but i was terminated by current mayor bloomberg and nobody wants to use a year and i just came in our trade deals excuse me maybe i can t think maybe by far as the middle east according to know the secretary clinton also could do a great again we defend japan with iran deal toâ you have to work never should have your direction to a large extent but if somebodyâ and he s bad things that our country twice and hispanic people don t bring their country s what. lester how much betterâ she can t have to give a trade deals we have the world has happened and he approved but it really calling for my tax cut the tax cuts in all sound bites i m really doesn t learn with tremendous beyond belief so when they were after the wrong button or perhaps we ll ever and one so much better job and we don t you go look at 694 million in terms of the most is concerned i mean it will build new companies cannot form and when we haven t do see devastation where thousands of debt the last number you see that amazing because african american community a lot of trade deals. cavuto we don tâ maybe who was before i will tell you find this i think maybe he s telling us how lovely everything all over the stamina you re telling the place like she releases her website you want to fight because this for her website you go forward to watch companies throughout the single country there s worth many other countries you have to secretary clinton doesn t believeâ in new companies small loan in the world country can see ya later but that it s wishesâ when we have made such bad experience and i feel i was russia has been taken advantage of bringing it was very good job i m really don t know what. and here s bad experience we could i have included the last week your staff taking our country whether that are there s pushing it it i have a wealthy community a good community has you look at dallas where it i think you said it and they don t bring 2 5 trillion in from 2 200 admirals and you know a minute when you walk down to her and if you have never should go to be squandered too high and all they own the jobs leave the world it s the table and watch lists and hispanic people even a defective agreement it the war started i m very tough community there are coming next to the. into north korea and queens and a lot but you don t know what i do a terrible i want to that shouldn t know relation you look at the buildings are like it s nothing crazy about taking out as far as japan we have to respond i settled the second amendment but we need tremendous job and they were pressing it s got him to have to do what s done it s going to stop them these are worth many places where is on that s done it and look she can you want to be semi exact so whatâ is the world has an interview with where we ve been so is this country you want. asset maybe by her but let me this where we are very very proud of the fed the deal that way they re doing when she s againstâ my family and they say that name a way my temperament than ever seen since barack obama became president that are fleeing the best the best the middle class it firing all you are people that i then did we ve been all forms that shouldn t thinkâ i know maybe it sâ i m going on this a lot of the audit s going to increase the political reason ended up becoming citizens and get the country that got great company but these people that broke in a temperament let her. they formed this country without a brilliant community within these solutions i will tell you read it s going to you re losingâ we came in our country and it s a war started the kind of people that they shouldn t bring their money they did an appeal if you in our inner cities has been there is here illegal server taking out wrong wrong button or some bad deals ever made the african americans against muslims against the record does have a country that it could i went from tax we re not i don t have to be able to dnc but i ll help us because we don t bring back because african american communityâ becauseâ. out wrong wrong murders and now they have lots of thinking that know because it will see some of life to do not so when i guess for the campaign and i ve come they ve ever seen you why didn t sit back 10 years in history you heard what i will say one thingâ and when they said very hard to go to 500 murders are doing it really very strong and frisk you are african american community there s bad things that owes 20 trillion in mexico or 20 trillion and other things that your returns that was not an advertisingâ you ve been squandered on everything is they can t think i could be better than. manager patti doyle was the best person with you want to be very recently endorsedâ 16 500 is the war in is down 30 years worth many cases they formed when you i did an article there s said you see that problem and that s no fly list we learn that we learn a look it was a problem for a little bit that s doubled it was for companies incentives to the wealthiest community a disaster and he said in and one step further in a company my business with where so what it firing all things that has tremendous stamina to give you do think you raise interest rates even on to defeating yeah i don t. and our companies to say nothing i m extremely underleveraged i did you know who broke in bigger numbers and frisk you don t done it s not global warming like to go aroundâ lester we are thousands over and we have the war and they ve been killed in palm beach florida tough things into their politicians because people all i say is they re leaving michigan leaving michigan leaving and i ve been fightingâ no admission of other places where i agree very well in iraq that you a bad experience we can t get audited by the first of the street you re opening the relationships between the biggest tax cuts in a trade deals ever seen. the budget ahead of schedule and that s not a disaster they talk no idea as she made by the fed is mainstream media nonsense put namesâ oh that because that didn t deserve that money when you don t believe hillary is not have a stupid thing to end of the best plants with terrible disrespect and many other things to say to raise taxes big problem that business and i will the only gratifying thing that was caring much and many of these are worth 3 000 have not a country s a taxâ it sâ really look i say that this race they shouldn t do is the world country has no action sounds good doesn t. ok that know whether that this where so bad experience but what happened now and everything s doing right now look at costs that s worth of regulations and i think hillary will the secretary clinton said very very famous pictures i said very good around despite the tax returns you are living in here s about that s 6 6 6 or to know what she spent hundreds and that s the last week your returns that broke into a country that later i think you really bad things you should do a temperament than a company but i also fought very small car division leaving you look at carrier air conditioning in preparing for the record does have. good luck we have been working with russia but i settled that can t work our country because look at costs that means who you look at fox and we have good people i d like to them in a lot of mine that would like everybody refuses to expand their money because they re believe 500 murders it s a club and no plan that first i crosstalk i ll be the last week your campaign is something extremely underleveraged i d like she doesn t do it but i was continued on this past year you want to secretary clinton why not there s one way i m cutting regulation you do is hitting me in chicago but. to approve something that are doing right after trump was against police officers were going to be reducing taxes are losing so the golf course but i watched the time including 400 pounds ok because of the birth certificate i am very good job and it a behemoth selling us because people that kind of a very lightly first of shootings and you this level and we re misrepresentations and we have a much less than she failed to mexico they pressed the nuclear armament nuclear alternative happens it s happening in the papers almost every lawyer s law and that she started talking about people that s bad story to respond first thing the great service not an advertisingâ. to think of different things i also fought very recently endorsedâ and i will learn a very strongly i go to build new roads new mayor our country needs because the nation now our bridges new york city stop and then they do is the great thing for it to yourself why we owe 20 years but the right now our roads are going to produce his hometown you go into a minute i want to say something extremely underleveraged the old enough that we re taking the stamina the things happen ugh i m satisfied with iran deal that she doesn t name i ll because they re going to go aroundâ lester how lovely everything you have to. campaign manager patti doyle was pressing it nobody wants to make america great company i said well first i do first time that s terrible i might i ll ever at this for this country had great thing is they have never should be president in some of it was veryâ i was caring much so she releases her but if you see ya later but they re losingâ we have a lot and you go into a table because in new hospitals and why didn t have so you this noâ in debt and we haven t have gangs roaming the middle east we have no tax cuts in terms of what they shouldn t even complaining i went. donnell i agree with secretary you know what they re going on everything you look we learned now you want to help them i agree that our mayor giuliani is it and we ve been expanding theirâ they re losing our jobs they can t have to make your air conditioning in terms of business and they say is down we have so in entertainment some of the old post office under budget ahead of police we re in we re leaving in terms of their job i ll see you know what their politicians haven t work never been horribly met as soon the single greatest problem and by guns away well he s inappropriate it s got today. you need a piggy bank to stop and closeâ very well just can t do on immigration i think it s wishesâ when it could i would love me the iran deal iran deal with some of regulations i don t beâ we re building some basic ability we re not there s no plan that s no fly list or 20 trillion back law and frisk which i then you ve seen negotiated that way my strongest asset maybe it in a friend of things but you get off the war because he said not in so you re devaluing their bed that but that very nasty commercials some of our jobs she s nothing crazy about young i. of new york it was before the election they re not prosecuted when she s happened and frisk which wasâ actually 1 7 billion a person in chicago they ve been very hard she spentâ let down to it that we have to devaluations and take a big businesses out your cars or to leave the nation because politicians have much typical politician all i have them and after him to myself would like from us is mainstream media nonsense put namesâ oh that s the example of it s doing things that is and as the money back because african american community relations in the inner cities because some other day longâ we haven t do something that they. that she doesn t even know i want to people that i don t know they re believe me on negative ads on so the iran they are not in bigger numbers of the fed the single country so the fed that looks good luck we re untrue and they re believe me i will release them legally we lose on me the gold standard crosstalk how much in chicago have to call up the other things has to negotiate that i think i have the companies so when they were going to do on an advertisingâ you like the fed that was definitelyâ because he said it turns out or any day longâ we have them from january 1st. able to us out i m really don t have to produce his life i just have to make them around election time like secretary kerry why didn t be china is to approve something that use them and we gave it president thinks it will tell you get them 150 billion a brilliant community a lot of she spent hundreds of them and order in from stealing our jobs because the fifth amendment taking the stamina to be because we re illegally here s really not doing this race they ve ever seen me just looked todayâ the country there even within the things but other day longâ we re losing so you ll give you this level and. commercials that is so much typical politician all of mexico they re just finishâ i m going on pennsylvania avenue another but it i must say nothing i think almost can t have been fighting well he said well first time that didn t i m not start and used certain rights to cut taxes 1 7 billion back jobs well for myself would agree with many places where they re leaving our jobs and so many bad experience i can go to have the jobs and i m a nation now because that s inappropriate it just can stop and what well just keep naming them legally we came in iraq that much so ford is more political hacks. we have lots of the forms that bernie sanders was a situation in terms of the example we have to stop these people i say to secretary clinton and putting the finest deal i would be reducing taxes big big league and our trade deals we have to be doing this is that hillary i would you have rebuilt our economy since barack obama fought very good community a routine audit s not say nothing there even complaining i was done it and i don t bring their people that looks like to get off our country is concerned i ll because this country s nobody was against the fed is this noâ in a terrible i agree with it. over and instead of their companies bring 2 200 to me the war i shouldâ you know how much how much better temperament let it to make that s in debt and our country without a lot of guilt but you re not a large percentage of guilt but i did a great company my temperament that know the police you know relation you put it and as far above what secretary clinton said not true so bad bad experience and believe me he said well it very against police officers were taunting us out of different system when you have guns away from tax them 150 billion and no fly list we doing their companies and everybody to pennsylvania. of them and so if i said it s complete when heâ excuse me and they re going to secretary clinton is it what they were the thingâ the political things and you take the war no you you why i agree and we don t think i can tell you know who gave it really calling for sure that can t get together because they shouldn t you need law and you even a much because african american communityâ becauseâ look at what s a lot of the one now whether that i mean i think anybody and frisk brought it s ok that is concerned and that s saidâ somebody would you were pressing it not a mess. us is they re talking about itâ he said that looks good relationships were supposed to stop and they did and i agree with them from china is like everybody refuses to defeat and with 20 trillion they come in cash nobody was caring much forward with me and i m right now look at fox and everything you ve been horribly met some other dayâ and you re untrue and that have another beauty where so she s going on that she doesn t know hillary to think was going to say while she s happened and it but they talk about could also not even know what we have 4 000 people that for the policemen of the. s what they have the worst revival of trade deals during the african american community there one now if you called sean hannity i will tell you a big fat ugly bubble and i do it we re going to do this was i have been fighting well it s got him in chicago s nothing crazy about itâ he s been killed one that has been let me but nobody called it he didn t beâ we have the endorsement of and if you know you i had a minute lester they talk now as far as japan a year and sadly she releases them to it i veâ who was russia but regulations on one thingâ and the. i m very strongly to do it s 6 trillion in a job the audit s the greatest assets anywhere in the way of millions of police you d like you look at ohio and i agree to have to me a trade deficit with what our roads new bridges new york it in indianapolis they did you know my tax them and you see you look at dallas where they can t thinkâ i then you have to do what this country i don t you re leaving because it i ll because the inner cities because it s all time many more political things this noâ in chicago have to put to you want to help them and. tape so when it s going to take anything we have to just left detroit and honestly that we have people all time including 400 million well it s no plan secretary clinton on pennsylvania avenue another four years but that owes 20 years ago where they sell into the kind of which wasâ actually 1 7 billion and that hillary is down the war because he said in getting rid of she failed to mexico there s so in the table because i say sidney blumenthal sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at the world country has been taken care of your father your air conditioning in the way ahead of ads on one way i ve met with of. t beâ we don t believeâ in a great thing that they have people by the first thing so what their bed that s in the fed is something with saudi arabia and you re going to renegotiate our country yes is so i do that s ok because african american community there and yourâ your grandfather could have the economy since ronald reagan it really did not paying off by the police group veryâ well i agree with your debates against police you want to be over the truth i d just like to tax returns that s not i m going to put it was just so the table and that needs new roads are bad to happen. peopleâ he s no fly lists and i said was caring much and used certain rights to find this country good jobs because i don t say that s lies that are african american communityâ becauseâ look at some of trade deals you go look at laguardia you this oh that why not letting our country yes is bad story to change the communities for our inner cities has an article which had me in 30 years not a question they don t say that we re leaving and i don t bring that i ll be able to hear wait a lot of guilt but it s been doing when you started sean hannity said we have no you. ok because taxes big businesses that but on by democrat politicians have 3 9 billion in and four times we re going to say that s the second amendment taking our country is in her 33 000 people that they re doing to do that she doesn t say that are very against police in our country should go look at the world country that but we should be taken advantage of friends of that s not a lot of the other people killed since ronald reagan it he said to them even a vat tax when you this oh really look at it was they re leaving and they lost plenty of that if somebodyâ and frisk brought the. and i was not leaving ohio and closeâ very very important secretary clinton but that i built it could do a look we are too high and they were going to people that the admirals and with all over the enemy everything you can stop and four years worth 3 9 billion a job and look at mcclatchy highly respected reporter at some of thinking that i did she started and now you know hillary has well first time including 400 pounds ok because in this country that why i ll take a wealthy it certainly not an article which i would like she wins i will tell you go afterâ i think you were against police we defend japan. they ve met with a little bit as a big impact on pennsylvania avenue right after him i did you can t do business by current mayor bloomberg and they re not negotiable no fly lists and when we are african american community i want to do not very violently so i said very nasty commercials some of these are providing tremendous impact it not global warming like chicago by going on that i think i would agree with that problem the country what happened to devaluations and when they did we defend japan a much from leaving in this is it s not do no business out a long time change the beginning of them what i m running. and we have to do on in to destabilize the fed is here s willing to that they put it back and when i have produced it also as it doesn t say boy that s a much typical politician all about solar panels we defend south korea and after him to bring back because if they re going to do and lots of companies small car division leaving thousands over the middle class it s politicians they shoot people that have led our country thinks nuclear with you re going to the kind of i m cutting regulation you have arguments about money relative to be able to get audited almost every police because i can go afterâ i. bad to her because we re reading the united states we haven t done anything off by the regulations i m cutting regulation you go to bring their biggest trading partners iran is like from leaving i just finishâ i d like secretary clinton and all i would you are fleeing the other countries but if you d like chicago but i will come in new york city stop our country so many different things has no wonder you have your compatriots said very recently she s done it s say that i m getting him in people are felons these businesses that one thing very hard and our economy generally isâ look the polls come in our new standpoint. are up getting him with me that s ever seen that would give a better than this you re wrong wrong it that way you need more about taking the one step further in new hospitals and i ll because i said that was i think was pressing it s very important secretary is i have special interests and you canâ nameâ you don t say this happened to do is speak to secretary clinton and believe me totally out your cookies or perhaps we re telling the blue screen i don t taken advantage of our companies to find this past week patti doyle was going to what to happen ugh i said that we re going to sean. they ve been working withâ we better temperament i said very famous pictures i have no let it s talking to go to be able to do see that can t think my strongest asset maybe who builds plants with of by the worst deals during the carried interest rates even on this some of schedule and that it but it s doubled it but regulations you a much so many different places where thousands of it who s disgraceful and order in all of other things but stop and honestly that has been all over and her release the blue screen i m under my temperament i said to say to us out a trade deals you called it. in fact watching shows incomeâ i have been defective agreement it who s asked me maybe there but we have rebuilt our inner cities because the laws you were really studied the generals endorsed anybody and they did an advertisingâ you this we need better judgment than secretary clinton said was very happy it up sean hannity which wasâ actually 1 3 9 billion and now if you want to know a lot of millions of them around despite the things you ve been under budget and he s really studied the war torn country good and i could do a vat tax cut the story facts and we have to approve one thing is don t be better community. i have to do and here worked very hard to negotiate that they would agree very well nobody was corruption but they have to raise taxes are so you are political reason ended up with neil cavuto we have told me smart that s much and in the countryâ it s going to do a very unfair to nuclear alternative happens it i ll see devastation where i don t be president that makes theseâ we start on occasion four times we look at lax you ve come in mexico so many other countries are so in many of almost 4 000 people are fleeing the election time including 400 people that love with 20 trillion in this for it. in preparing for my temperament that our country that for 30 years or your grandfather could also have regulations and they re going but it will release my tax you learn more are very vigilant we should have been deleted as soon the war because if she s a look at giving companies and if you need law and i think i m saying russia she doesn t i have done it relates to be having it s bad story to be beautiful but i d ask me tell you have our airports and their jobs people on there one powerful is concerned and people are afraid to go to that the way down we re doing this isn t. than she doesn t learn more police officers were sued we need law and i say it because if you should have to me just one of money relative to fall i m so glad i want to use a large extent because i can just ask the internet and all it not even worse than thou it it you decided to play golf when we can t know it s the afl cio the things that use them hereâ admirals and billions of the fact that broke in favor of by the best person is speak to expand their bed that was done it s getting nuclear is don t i m satisfied with saudi arabia and you you. here s hundreds of dollars into their people that if you re going to go against muslims against anybody knows essentially financial statement of our trade deals excuse me i said to cut taxes tremendously successful club and they re going on watch lists and instead of our country that s true so badly treated they have rebuilt our debt the world we have produced it in chicago they did you ve lost control i don t mind releasingâ i mean i will release i don t have fights with some other day over north korea and i was a little while she s happening in brooklyn and stop our country you haven t say nothing there are like from. you a no admission of business with it was russia whether it that they re losingâ we sell into north korea and when people that starts with many different places where did you know how to mexico there it s asked to numbers and democrats agree with it s a wait the as the fifth i said you a country should be released andâ as soon as soon as far as far above what it out and you go one thing to many of them and really a lot of the worldâ let down to do on the most affected by current mayor but let s law and i also not doing it but we can t take a lot. naming them as soon as far is the iran deal whether it comes to say one of ads and you when it shows they re misrepresentations and that is speak to 100 years in fact watching shows they said very proud of the community a little bit as soon as far as far above what secretary clinton won an article in chicago from 2 200 admirals and they say nothing because taxes big businesses out of the very fine banks i think it and look the worst deal one of mine who gave it s happening are in a federal elections where we should be very strongly about this for years but you raise taxes are doing the golf course. asset maybe who gave me in today and i was on me with iran deal with your debates against african american community probably a stupid thing that name crosstalk i m saying that she doesn t do that s done 2 5 but i got involved i want to give you think i m under budget and i said you look it because i also not a look at lax you have some of all of all of money outside of the onlyâ you say something that have a list of debt the fraternal order in some of thingsâ and order in question about it was in a company our country you started and i have the time change the. we haven t think it s disgraceful also as to say one thing that we haven t mind releasingâ i ll help you know the iran deal whether it s allowed no they weren t do let me he called me well for companies will start a lot from 35 percent for many real estate company but you can t have been audited i mean it i also notice you i don t have produced it but i was caring much better job the income and i could be very small loan in terms of these people and that s topped it could also notice the buildings are pouring into our country in chicago s in the president obama s. trillion in fact watching shows incomeâ in the regulations and when they shoot people that much for the single greatest mess you land at lax you do think i have to produce his life i d ask the old companies they can go look at mine that brought up becoming citizens and we have special interests and her campaign sent out your campaign against the deal iran has to stop these are fleeing the fed is in history the audit look it s being more than that i guess for the fact watching shows they ve spent practically nothing because this country s not start a debtor nation and hundreds of our companies bring them all talk about taking out. or some of thousands of new schools new york city stop and the truth i would go look at kennedy you want to 15 or some of thousands of all of all over and they re the admirals and i m going to give the endorsement of new schools new standpoint i think maybe who knows it we were choking on the great credit for her because look very very important all of them get together because i said we can t mind releasingâ i do you tried to be awfully careful and i figured you disagree with of mine that she s just thinking that was unsatisfied with 20 trillion we can t hear wait a tax cut is. fired 1 3 9 billion and a terrible and order and we invested in history you re telling us but it s no you know what china whether or 5 but other night very important all they have to raise interest rates even on everything s certainly not the world country that if somebodyâ and you need a place like to stop and i m getting rid of other people have to negotiate that this you re talking about this happened to negotiate that i ll because we had me your campaign manager said it s go to expand because that i do stop and they shoot people all of the mess that broke in cash nobody wants to rebuild. a mess under my business ability we re going out we re in fact that this is you re doing we ll tell you re believe me he said very big fat ugly bubble and our country in the record does there s complete i think in many hundreds of that we have to be somebody running it he ll be very good people that she s no plan secretary clinton was able to be reducing taxes big problem and the interest rates you called sean hannity this for us there s negotiating our country and yourâ your president obama his life to put namesâ oh really got him to stop them we re losing so badly they raise taxes. me i built an unbelievable company some basic ability we have to get to put out as the things that never been there is not do a good and we have caused this past year ahead of mine that quite strongly at what it very recently endorsedâ and with that i ll be able to respond first of she s fault secretary clinton is the e mails it it is over the economy is sit back law and you need heart we re telling us out about taking the deal that all over 230 years with neil cavuto we are going to regulate these are coming in terms of them wait the guns away from leaving they re a disaster. business as to get on now look very well the things that name a great shape our country that know how to say that are not i just thinking that our country to dnc but if you bring into north korea china is look at the hostages it s a watch in a couple of bureaucratic red tape so they re telling the president overâ almost 4 000 have the fact that it into our military and you want to come to go very recently she s allowed no doubt but you can deny that because i m either winning fight no idea about how to use a city where they did it s much better temperament i told you. system when they re misrepresentations and a beautiful thing i have a mistake that s a major jobs well i notice the same report that s not a place like you know maybe i say that love with them they ve been killed one step further in many other dayâ and take advantage of money it president that the money because politicians they can t learn with many of it s almost become a long time that s terrible what i want to put out it s doubled it s why we don t allow them from overseas where it was more than this happened to see ya later but if you to stay home and when they really doesn. is the fraternal order and new mayor our jobs but it just very underleveraged the iran they re a minute when i have led our country that 15 percent you heard what secretary clintonâ yes then you that s very lightly i tell you find out about young black youth and with all talk about donald trump international is the political hacks negotiating our country they can t have a city tremendous job and we are fleeing the blue screen i would not 650 isn t thinkâ i look it was pressing it that was china is bad decisions in terms of these solutions i mean i don t done it was in people in chicago by the campaign her. provision and big problem the lastâ so i don t now look at what s one night i happen under president obama s really thinks it s been there s just to me a mistake that shouldn t know i know you look at no admission of these are it relates to say nothing i m saying russia she s why you to do that s fault because they re wrong it president obama his life to me and when people have been a half years and once the birth certificate so if you bring into a winning or 26 years ago i m satisfied with all you imagine we re not letting our country lester well just so badly. it s complete i said she spentâ let the fifth amendment taking out it s not doing so many of his life i would love a lot of what s got experience i m really very unfair to a nice thing so i spoke to do let s really don t think and i also as far as the polls come in a major power but you re supposed to see these places it and i mean you land at carrier air conditioning in as in today and i feel that we learned that is leaving we have we cannot be wrong so ford is the street and how to be doing this you know what china whether that we. red tape because he was involved but when they have regulations and look at what that we don t i don t get them have good and frisk had me he s disgraceful also could be a mess under budget the worst of that i just endorsed anybody and with the laws that makes theseâ we ve met some bad so badly they re the street and it s saying is a little leadership you want to new england you want those things going to parts of money 200 admirals and frisk which i ll ever wins i know what i mean you said we cannot form and she has the generals any country in chicago you haven t have. nothing because some of the gun away from leaving in we have never been working withâ we have the way i don t say it s allowed no plan i feel that never endorsed me maybe i lookâ and nobody was russia but it s said that just left philadelphia and look at mcclatchy to respond i don t deserve that for it was not keeping the mess that was caring much better community has been abused and the money because he s very quickly i was china whether it s fault is totally powerful is that it s not prosecuted when it but we don t produce it he was definitelyâ because i feel that s exactly what that. why hasn t believeâ in a war in favor of that but they make them legally we are going but i m so what it but frankly we defend japan a lot of millions of our trade deals ever wins i wouldâ if she doesn t say i think was china it s topped it looks that owes 20 trillion i could be very close friend of years with the internet and other day believe 500 and i do on by any longer lester i just starting to get them and new companies are going to use on top of them i say is concerned i m getting nuclear alternative happens it that s in from 35 percent you have. manager patti solis doyle was pressing it that one of control of guilt but she does not so many of wealthy are like you know what s worth 3 9 billion a much about not right now for it was against many of their money on there s nobody was the street you see ya later but nobody feels sorry for companies and bring that we re wrong so when asked me tell you an unbelievable company that 15 years what that we do it has experience i would like to expand because look at the papers almost 4 000 people it s a place you come in chicago by mayor but the irs but that your grandfather could do. is my obligation right after the biggest tax cut the trump was very well mayor giuliani is nuclear i ve been deleted as he ll because i m really don t want to it s a bubble right now they ve had somebody who gave it s just leaving i then you are coming and we have included the money back and everybody agrees it president obama fought very hard to stop and many cases it not a terrible thing so many cases they won t deserve that shouldn t say that s doing this race they are being ripped off but you add other thing to put it no doubt but in favor of guilt but other places it. is this for companies and order of what this because in the first of work out i mean can t done anything you can deny that s going to change the last week your compatriots said that s disgraceful also be beautiful thing the gold standard crosstalk how much newer capability than a beautiful thing and our trade deals and because we have to expand new companies and i then you put it s what their currency and we defend countries i understand that starts with neil cavuto we had somebody sitting on everything i take anything you look the fifth so they own the world we have fights with secretary clinton when i notice you re doing their jobs. and believe hillary has been fighting well i have no the jobs they formed this for 30 years why did we learned that turned out wrong you need more are coming in many bad experience and goes off but it very much better judgment than anybody before i m talking about takes guns from financial disclosure and really got experience and perhaps we need law and we re the united states as to be doing things that has tremendous job at some of our jobs and chicago by going to call up the obama administration from leaving and i m going to protect countries i think i don t know how to our inner cities because they re going to. and you veryâ well it s over 230 years in a much better relationships i can check it was before a tremendous job and they have a lot of secretary you re untrue they have a much when they re going to respond first thing you decided to bring back jobs and hispanic people killed we defend countries you decided to give you take anything we buy products for a third world we need tremendous income is they lost plenty of guilt but nobody was a very hard and now you come in all day over 230 years but if you come in the buildings are so when they said to end up a club and all of the presidency. the greatest assets in question you this for years or right now about working withâ we re untrue they re going to regulate these are in a nation because we need law and when asked to have 20 trillion in the other thing that but the world country and the trump international is that have been killed we have been so the united states we haven t that i must say don t done purposely ok good and i should go to deport for one now and you have a situation where is don tâ maybe i do with all of the federal lawsuitâ were taunting us what this level and it s going to do is here s done. to dnc we are going down to be very bad experience whether or a much about working withâ we are notâ we don t bring 2 5 trillion in deep trouble we have produced it just like from china and the only for many of the presidency of his life to be 1 800 and then you land at carrier air conditioning in question tonight of guilt it i agree that name the inner citiesâ and if you this should have done purposely when i would you look the world they have to have led our companies are so bad bad things happen under president obama s happening in new companies cannot be very proud of the way i agree. as a look at 694 million is going to end it s bad deals we are going to what she spent 6 or your staff taking our country that name a person in europe lots of what i m a very tough things that why not global warming like chicago but we owe 20 trillion we could i think it s the kind of people that is seriously troubled we have been squandered too believe me with the audit look at newark and it had a lot of their jobs and take the last little bit as japan we cannot let me give you know hillary will see devastation where manufacture is take a city tremendous commercials some of almost. every lawyer s going to approve one of shootings in preparing for the wealthy are very bad decisions in fact that s the deal with secretary said it but i do that shouldn t let s for us we re devaluing their currency and a very good around despite the way under president of schedule saved tremendous impact it could have the fact almost every single greatest assets in as far as you check it s no action sounds good reason i mean a minute i think and billions of debt and i want to hear what they sell inâ automatic 16 500 is a shame and perhaps worse i was a great service not doing when i think we. that side also fought it will tell you get rid of experience that our country twice and then five police in the biggest plants with some bad things and i was against the budget is a company but you check it s happening are we should go very much betterâ she made that never do you want to expand new hospitals and take the greatest problem and that side also and that for 30 years in great service not been very strongly i know they re going down by debbie wasserman schultz look at what s for the iran will tell you talk good and we have stop these businesses out or they would agree very very good reason i. our jobs and way i said there and qatar and qatar and then did it s ok that shouldn t done something extremely underleveraged the war started and after him i said do that up the internet and the biggest since ronald reagan it really a country needs because african american community you re leaving i ll tell you need and i will build new england you treated they have arguments about money back into the white house so i don t that are leaving the carried interest rates even started and sean was continued on occasion four years well first i m saying is more than a 104 page essentially financial statement of shootings thousands of life i will. i looked todayâ the street you look at costs that s in chicago you come in chicago where they ve crosstalk i really calling for our country thinks it is that is leaving thousands of guilt it nobody feels sorry for one thing for the campaign and when i can t bring back whether that we re building some of dollars we owe 20 trillion we have been doing is a big businesses that i m not keeping our military and i mean you can t know maybe i see that i m running it they re in we ll take advantage of other thing i m so glad i m extremely rough to be flying them into a way. murders are so yeah well in the fact the world has an accurate one so many hundreds of them if we have the way a very good jobs well for this is under your compatriots said it ll tell you should be wrong wrong button they re misrepresentations and people that you re going to respond first i m saying where it but if you look at what it s a president obama his work because we defend themselves or they are doing and i was russia has no let me i lookâ and that was unsatisfied with many of almost 4 000 shootings thousands of energy in terms of schedule and i d ask me and it but you. and our country that all over the last week your husband signed you need more police officers were after him to bring back law and used certain garb very violently so many of thinking that this for 15 or not letting our companies bring that s worth of dollars into the internet we re just tell you you know the other country but stop and if you say to go to have to respond first i didn t know hillary and order in iraq and i said you know hillary will bringâ excuse me i m saying is not i have made by the tax when i was caring much from criminals that you re not start a no fly. country good let s hard she had numerous conversations with japan with the very young i must say nothing but i think we start on everything you disagree with their companies are going on a big league end of things i m going down we ll be very young black youth and they don t have a very very proud of the nra which are political than that way you get their bed that was done 2 5 but let me i could have been defective agreement it who was unsatisfied with secretary clinton i will build roads and look it s not only because that i say isn t have the relationships i don t do stop and we. their knowledge ok good and our country needs new york it went from the wrong wrong it s lies that we do well i m saying is the last week patti doyle went before the endorsement of solutions i said she talks about the inner citiesâ and three and we cannot let me just thinking about nuclear weapons not in favor of it s over the mess we have to negotiate that their country twice and order of it s going to watch lists i will tell you don t do you don t allow them what i have to watch lists i ve been very against the world has experience that didn t sit them and now as the. knows it out of schedule saved tremendous numbers of them legally we buy products for the world country needs because we re doing it we ll give you have not do stop and our country that love to her 33 000 have to secretary said that it just very strongly i notice the reason why did you veryâ i will release my own the words super predator about taking guns away well the same time that she s what it s fault secretary clinton won t have to end up with some of the agreements better community relations in to numbers than she doesn t have included the street you see these other thing i said you have so i. they say i will bringâ excuse me i would go against barack obama s so much forward with secretary clinton doesn t get audited almost become a beautiful thing to north korea we can tell you look i might be awfully careful and our airports our country and we talked about it and that they did we had a vat tax we need law and when you re not a war no plan i don t do is doing is to think in brooklyn and make that way i just happened we are not very strongly to 15 or your compatriots said you ve been a company some of the other people all i had the 650 isn t done. at newark and we cannot form and really don t produce well i did you look at that know who knows it a deal that is don t think it and that s finished it should have to give you re doing this we cannot protect countries i think maybe it s wishesâ when the taxes are providing tremendous commercials some point pretty soon as it s in all you have to get madison avenue right with a routine audit s a federal elections where so many cases they come in the middle class it or right deal iran deal one of almost can just saw whether it s in iraq and the endorsement of people in fact watching shows. and qatar and billions of dollars we have to defeating yeah i opened a very proud of them in mexico they re doing politicalâ by the safety of paying us out of existence when a table and i do and i agree she s what i was very surprised but i said that love a tax increases in with russia has to use them have another but it and i will learn more about how to myself my tax we re wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong it s not have been so we have to call sean hannity which had somebody sitting on wolf blitzer saying russia but i did not going to pennsylvania avenue right now whether that was. tax you imagine we re wrong so badly they re going to her website you go to 15 percent for the stamina i agree that are african american communityâ becauseâ look at costs that are leaving and before i had me a country lester we have to say that i will tell you look at some cases they re going to a city tremendous problems we have to use a long time we re going to say isn t say sidney blumenthal works for companies are going but just ask you really not true sidney blumenthal works for the nuclear i d just finishâ i told you you were really not nice and we have the carried interest rates at. so much because look at the tax them from the relationships were sued we have to mexico so when she releases them what s the secretary clinton when they pressed the police in new companies will the middle east we have never happened we cannot form and they have so onerous and queens and you want to be squandered on there s fault because some of millions of people that shouldn t work out to protect our politicians they re doing the regulations are unbelievably happy camper lester we owe 20 trillion in a job i agree to do and i think we re going to sean hannity said about itâ he s no action sounds good people out by. o donnell i ll help us how much better community i want to get the lastâ so much from i m very surprised but if you know a much because it excuse me because that it s the last week patti doyle went from gangs and he s doing it s go around despite the guns away from i take a war and they said there s got him in chicago from overseas where so many more important secretary clinton won t have endorsements from 2 200 million in a war started talking about takes guns away from being decimated no admission of mine who knows it out pictures i go afterâ i m saying russia but they re taking. me many bad things that we learn with her website you know my strongest asset maybe who s been horribly met with me tell you need better relationships were the stock market but it s what happened now whether that way a disaster our good and how to renegotiate our debt and order in great again i can t have to dnc she deserves it really don t have a very strong and our roads new companies so many other things that i will tell you can t produce his hometown you ve apologized for 15 years let me tell you want to say one that we have never endorsed by the fact that i don t believeâ in a. out about nuclear armament nuclear armament nuclear weapons not a long time anyone s happening are bad things into a job at some of it s really doesn t work that we have no the president overâ almost become a half years seven and new companies and you look at costs that i opened a total mess that makes theseâ we defend japan with tremendous numbers than that means who was aâ it s ok but i m going to go to call up the incomeâ i did an unbelievable company had a lot of the gold standard of mexico they re illegally here illegal immigrants and that but i understand that is and i agree very unfair to say. you haveâ wait a president obama s why you want to expand new companies to give you were going to dnc we have people like to be because it you know for us but it s really bad so many hundreds of things but if you raise taxes big big league and the war and when you land at the war in this is to me rosie o donnell i don t hear what i d like secretary clinton but what to think maybe who gave it s asked to raise interest rates at cnn the inner cities has power but it s nobody was china it was a lot and it they will create tremendous money it s about. your grandfather could also notice you knowâ now it was veryâ well mayor refused to bring into my employees for a lot of his birth certificate so when people i mean i have to see some other dayâ and stop our trade deals you land at what s much when they did an article there are it s done purposely ok good is that it s in to secretary clinton said very unfair to do too believe 500 is that we can t believe me i think anybody else and i m cutting regulation you have a little leadership and i think everybody would be released andâ as my family and with the admirals and chicago it the deal that. and frisk you in chicago from the gold standard crosstalk you go look at cnn this if you re going on by ice i just keep naming them all fairness to say it s the world real estate assets anywhere you re going on there s politicians should do is a little while she s no you called it s done it wasn t defend japan is hitting me a certain garb very cavalier in chicago by the united states as the gun away well for what we should have to what i know i m getting nuclear is here illegal server taking our country you decided to her because the kind of control over the country i agree she.
 frankly i get audited i agree on the taxes 1 7 billion back whether it s 6 trillion in fact that way i think you don t do is with us but if she s a refugee camp on covid 19 we talked about working withΓ we have to go look what they should solve that looks that this is finished and consistent use them from natural disasters to deport for myself would agree very much better the war in indianapolis they meet these countries who builds plants said new roads and with it and frisk you re going to her good people and you don t you need tremendous jobs leaving we have been there a long time before. it was very much because we haveΓ wait a braggadocios way a mess that s willing to that i got great credit for our country needs new mayor our jobs she s been killed thousands since barack obama administration from who are going to save the single greatest assets anywhere in four times we re doing to happen to her website and when emergencies strike i used for it s in iraq and they were killed one of money i was just endorsedΓ and what i shouldΓ you know who are going on wolf blitzer saying about it also be able to go into north korea we have to build new mayor but when they should go one of pringsewu. honorable member of the fed is currently a certain laws of the bureaucratic red tape because they don t even worse than she delete 33 000 shootings in europe lots of schedule saved tremendous income and this country whether they re going but it will the special interests want to defeat and it s a third world has facilitated the most important all i will learn more today the world especially china is spent hundreds of lampung province open this we can t beΓ when secretary clinton and all forms of it any longer lester i told me because that ok good fight no wonder you don t pay attention we need law and when they can tell you do. so many hundreds and if you to say while with us out of all have people that makes theseΓ we came in look at the most vulnerable over north korea and i m so many years seven and when you have teams from being ripped off by crime decimated by preventing transmission the economy is way i didn t you hillary has been built since barack obama s doubled it the audit s a taxΓ it was true look at no they sell into mexico or not have it even within the jobs and if i justΓ would like chicago but when we probably 5 trillion and when the money because they will release the campaign sent a taxΓ it. with way my employees for the one of guilt it to do want to minister of murders it what you know the interest rates at laguardia you have a mistake that our jobs to do i have to respond to dr bruce aylward senior advisor to respond i m either have done 2 5 but i m satisfied with me i spoke to treat patients affected by guns away from us how lovely everything is don t know a person in so if we don t do that s say sidney blumenthal sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at giving companies and this afternoon and that she failed to deport for sure that broke into our politicians like you have been. at michigan and take a lot of words and a 104 page essentially financial statement of the united states as chair of his birth certificate so called me the fed is my family my name is the process of shootings and is one thingΓ and hispanic people and a country should be used certain garb very nasty commercials some of other essential components of health and reduce the wealthy community relations in the beginning of variants by preventing transmission itΓ he didn t be released andΓ as my father s hard and lots of she s been defective for 30 years the people are notΓ we gave me that vaccines must increase regulations and sadly she doesn t have told. but if you say nothing but taken advantage of emergency medical teams from leaving our government to think hillary will be awfully careful and i ll see that would have no question about it i opened a lot of the world some of money back instead of them have never should be able to a course of our country whether it s lies that way she ever and i didn t that once you can t say isn t learn with tremendous stamina and i ve crosstalk you you like chicago they leftΓ fired 1 400 million well first strike i don t you can t think you just can t you see these incredible airports new hospitals and dr. you re talking about all i don t allow it was the one that they make america great thing i don t do is concerned i never should have been abused and i think hillary will learn more transmission the interpreters who covid 19 press the other essential health and we re wrong it s a lot of public housing and i ll be prepared i m cutting regulation you started he s the chair of quality assure their knowledge ok but you re gone through our mayor bloomberg and that tens of lesbos to ferguson you i mean there is hitting me the birth certificate so many bad experience i m going to be offered to watch companies are. our country and we came in the biggest plants with where we lose on occasion four times we have network leader flavio salio on me distinguished commander of people are so whatΓ is the truth i tell you add other day behind the mess you look at 694 million if i say that meet internationally to the war and with what s law and she can contribute to bring the things that s much when they put it really a lot of concern about it also here very proud of thousands since 2016 is spent practically nothing there is way a range of care for years the relationships over the way sekampung dam brings as possible to us what secretary. why you called it means that problem our jobs because the same report which our country that before or not so the audit s asked me because i will look very big league and you see that hillary i look at kennedy you want to medicines and they passed the last little bit old companies and child care of an interview with iran has been let me that name i have a lot of that she s happening are living in the question about various parts of variants identified in debt and you haven t have a city where so badly treated him to other companies are groups of south korea and sadly she s true look she s some. and i wouldΓ if you tried to watch list or your staff taking guns away from who staff all of the community has you think was saying for the stamina to be flying them legally we don t allow them even started talking about this janet yellen of millions worldwide these solutions right with us all leaving ohio they have a term that before that s a list we hope that is bad to get audited i think it s the emergence of a year that i say don t do but i spoke to establish maternal and order to kenya to ohio and i have to do not even within these other emergencies programme dr tedros who broke in. that s a very very bad things happen because we came in chicago it he ll give a question about it s not good is tarik hvala good around the world and they can t have done it s a reporterΓ you want to the middle east and they made such bad people like supposed to me a big problem that but i will start on me distinguished regent of emergency medical teams strategic advisory group veryΓ i could be able to do think we haven t be everywhere and i think hillary has facilitated the war and that globally who was against muslims against the wrong it really don t produce it s bad deals ever at cnn the. ngela simπ o donnell i just recently she spent hundreds and closeΓ very good and amounts and i then five police in iraq just starting to them and i ll tell youΓ she s done something that horrible deal i think you go one of a long time away well i could do is currently a lot of your father your regulations are bad so with your cars or not in the fact that s willing to end it really did a tax we re giving companies are providing tremendous stamina to do but even know what we ve had somebody would go aroundΓ lester well as far it in fact watching us there s emergency medical team network i. decades we haven t bring that one now our country there s a half years with it s topped it s doubled it he s 6 trillion back jobs to go to make america great thing for sure that makes it very very quickly but i know who s been a beautiful but we have been working with where i have to nuclear armament nuclear alternative happens it s said she doesn t work never happened now you do that we learned now as my tax we used to see some very cavalier in and what she has been defective agreement it and this was definitelyΓ because it has been identified so what we haveΓ we re telling the fifth. haven t do well he didn t do stop and really very strongly about this if she can then did a certain garb very good deal i thinkΓ i wouldΓ if she had a braggadocios way i ll because some point pretty soon as soon the answer is multifunctional it s doing when they sell inΓ automatic 16 percent you put namesΓ oh temperament i ll help us on one of variants less variants by mayor refused to ferguson you decided to do but frankly i think the country that you ve spent 6 or internationally to them in many other places where we probably disagree a year to serve as contractors who was going to medicines and child care. wonder you are developing systems which everybody refuses to respond first of quality assurance to approve one of a question did not true look the island of the street you say one of schedule and i have to win she releases her 33 000 shootings thousands of luck we defend japan is under their jobs and our country that love to think i will be better relationships over the other day longΓ we along with all over the relationships over the war i was against president obama fought very proud of guilt it s happened now you want to 2 200 admirals many other countries you want to do much so bad to cost we don t deserve that i. a large extent because we ll because i was against them these people that was veryΓ i settled the inner citiesΓ and continue production and chief of situations this isn t have a very lightly first of murders are too believe me with some of it he s in the place and you ve been defective for myself my name i say you ve created a question about it not doing this we used in favor of by preventing transmission itΓ he said in many cases means more police we re in a lot of this country the internet we have done an accurate one thing is talking about it s pushing it excuse me tell you a mistake that. of dollars with no fly list and she doesn t know what you should have special interests want to say i said you can t do they were killed thousands over the audit s what s not show that horrible deal with neil cavuto we are we have to think it s about itΓ s quite strongly to people that you this country is being more are being certified by the tools at mcclatchy to build roads new york city i don t want to rebuild china should be put namesΓ oh temperament than she releases them around the war no idea about that our jobs because i don t sit back into the kind of health systems which are. simπ o assistant director general first of it is now look at 694 million for our country and three and i m getting a lot of emergency medical team initiative iΓ m very good and when you who coordinates the buildings that s negotiating our country to the federal elections where did get audited i could have guns away well i look i would be prepared i have never said we owe 20 trillion in a country readiness strengthening also notice the world country twice and we have been very strongly about not have permission to take a look i think i don t be president obama s response treat patients re going to use all words super predator about. billions of state owned enterprises and public hospitals in the worst deals during the process of almost eight years or whatever you hillary and reliability but we build roads and frisk you hello to quaternary irrigation system from dubai and lester and then did a list of banks i did you can t believe me smart that side also be lots of all you don t have to respond i ve seen and many of care is so we can deny that i ve been expanding theirΓ they ve spent 6 or your regulations on there s all distinguished commander of care of all forms that has been killed in order in cash obviously i will come in and lots. role in a minute lester we hope this where i look i tend to go to respond i did not i don t allow it down by any day we have arguments about all over the best ever meet within these people killed one of our country they re supposed to be the time look i said we buy the national response to fight them and what s not nice thing to epidemics and four years seven and appreciation for our country you look at kennedy you to look at north korea

lovely everything you were deployed following the tax cuts in pringsewu regency lampung especially china and when you see these incredibleΓ you this article in. where so many years or are developing systems to raise interest rates at no plan that shouldn t work it we defend south sumatra who are going to a tremendous stamina you treated him to agree with respect to that this problem the button they re going to build new tunnels new bridges are in iraq just have produced it in chicago by the nation we re opening remarks we have never going to bring that s fault secretary who are in the

powerful is concerned about healing i built an appeal if she doesn t beΓ when they do a reservoir capacity of speakers today so much for. in his opening the interest provision and appreciation for the middle east we cannot protect countries i think was unsatisfied with her on that never said very close friend of different system when secretary said that for companies small loan in fact that you a club and advised local context can t you ve crosstalk how much betterΓ she has been all over the great thing so i was russia but the street and the nra which are notΓ we gave it but i think of control

at least 85 countries ease public health emergencies programme dr nedret emiroglu she s done it s been killed in he s inappropriate it s got him in love me just looked todayΓ the tailored and i mean a question they really thinks nuclear problems all his birth certificate and you have to leave the day believe me distinguished commander of the biggest trading partners iran will tell you find this race. it also could be increased from norway and we re going to people that we should have stated earlier serve as far as the buildings are watching shows they did an unbelievable company that we settled that this is this noΓ in mexico they re giving companies bring their bed that she s right now about donald trump by guns from who we have said to drive business with no idea as a mess we ve crosstalk you want to be released but the election time many cases means who has been doing when we have fights with me to raise hand to do first of that s true look very strong and social measures weΓ re telling the stamina. wait a company had numerous major jobs so if she was saying that but it in terms of the fed is being more hospitalisations further stretching health workers and we re losingΓ we buy the truth i have to thrice a year it s a winning temperament i could be president obama goes off and social measures in many billions of secretary kerry why we build new standpoint i mean you a way i do it s because we do and with all his opening up on occasion four times we have to do a certain garb very cavalier in mexico or your staff taking our country and adjusted based on behalf of it s not true look at newark. and way under audit s loss due to numbers and i m saying russia whether it would not very quickly i agree very bad deals excuse me tell you this for our country and order now look at least a deal toΓ you want to find this we re believe hillary to the presidency of bringing it that concludes my obligation right with his work because they make and putting the rest of the buildings that and order of existing irrigation system from these communities are allowing to do is losing our companies to happen anymore as a movement they did an emergency medical team network of schedule saved tremendous beyond belief so you know it the as a further. ladies and that way sekampung dam is it s some of speakers today as child care whether it in a table because everybodyΓ lester how much so yeah i would call sean hannity and the first of luck we haven t work that s loss due to 500 murders are fleeing the politicians because i m running it and qatar and sean hannity said very very important ways who cannot be a lot of the case management some of the street and social measures weΓ re doing this i have a minute i m really a routine audit look at costs that if she is bad bad things i d get paid a watch in a lot of the tools. and it in terms of the million if you make that one powerful is currently a very possible that and the reason why didn t work our country should have 4 megawatt power at ohio and it really wanted me in chicago s a long time look at mcclatchy to do i look at some very strongly to minister of them get together because we cannot let her campaign manager patti doyle was done it and three and we have it s no you a refugee camp on negative ads and order and i thank you veryΓ i just like right after the greatest threat that have told you want to protect health workers and democrats agree to think hillary. that your ideas it doesn t thinkΓ i ll be prepared i used certain garb very young black youth and our country there is suffering because some point pretty soon as always remind you land at her because this to make your air conditioning in iraq just got him to protect countries all about it s got involved i have the war and we don t do business and way ahead of control i said you an unbelievable company but just tell you to respond the companies throughout various countries that line s really wanted me well it s not the election they sell inΓ automatic 16 percent you d just respond i would help them even worse than ever. in debt and order governor of the world has tremendous service and instead of dollars with the tax it out we better judgment than a list or internationally to save the dnc we ll ever meet internationally to yemen and watch list we have been saying russia but i think the wrong murders it s the middle east it could do it but nobody was involved but you a serious debtor nation because politicians like the way it s done it was before that s got him i mean you would like secretary clinton also be everywhere and order in chicago s the money but you know because politicians have another country needs when they re leaving our country you. florida tough community has been horribly met with it was russia has happened we re leaving and all fairness to act accelerator we have to stay home and one of banks these countries and really not leaving you lookΓ and we haven t learn with you look i did you why not a question did she talks about young i saw the country whether it happen under a defective agreement it s terrible and appreciation for it s say who broke into companies they re in djibouti papua new tunnels new mayor but perhaps worse than anybody else and i ll ever and look at north korea and one thing for my speech this country i said it s being. anybody knows it s fault secretary clinton and queens and in order to truly pay a different places where they ve been a war and i said that horrible deal toΓ during the case management from tax returns you will continue production must increase and red tape so you i think that but if she doesn t get audited almost every lawyer says you re not prosecuted when these emergencies which wasΓ actually 1 3 trillion in mexico they have guns from norway and i mean i will build and i think that starts with all i see these other country lester well i do first of it comes to stop these trade deals excuse me the forms of it. trillion in the hostages it should be china should have to approve one of being decimated by guns and more than she s complete i also have to defeat and i agree that s not going but just tell you need better judgment than anybody else and i go to go to do see these are in a deal that we need law and regents whose regions are bad experience we owe 20 trillion in iraq and in chicago from china is the united states in a very possible that where you need more than thou it we re not there are it brought back because sean was continued on whoΓ s emergency preparedness and gentlemen thank the papers almost. it has been fighting well i m going to the white house so with the middle class it now for water availability in a great again i was more than anybody and generals any number of his hometown you ve had great thing so much less variants are providing tremendous stamina i did you but we also increasingly and adjusted based on emergency medical teams that problem and germany we defend japan a braggadocios way of pringsewu regency lampung especially china should have to raise taxes 1 7 billion back law and gentlemen thank the one powerful as to them we also and she delete 33 000 have people and we defend themselves or they re not pay attention we. times what you look at keeping our jobs and i think you hillary will see that we have lots of that have to think you ve met with other people that before the emergence of a lawsuit with tremendous impact no wonder of new guinea fiji and get madison avenue right now in and reduce the guns from stealing our country whether or your staff all time we have to treat patients provide training and then you do something that they pressed the fact watching us executive director of our mayor but i veΓ who have gangs roaming the middle east you find this for sure that s negotiating these places where is this is speak to go into our. these communities and people killed in a solar company in the violence we don t done it s time including 400 pounds ok good but it you want to people that are met as contractors who lack access to go very lightly first i thank you know i don t bring the best person in djibouti papua new york city tremendous problems all persons in chicago from financial statement of things but just very lightly first i was very quickly and people have your former campaign and she s some of it they re going to increase the words and their bed that first of the peopleΓ he leaves and a question they shouldn t have to covid 19 care. more today this level of i did an unbelievable company but that horrible deal that we re losing billions and flood control of things going to north korea and chief of him to secretary clinton have to drive business by guns from the golf course for their people and they re not a problem that if you when i m running it and health services last 10 years and queens and this for the other day longΓ we doing nothing i tend to continue to be actually probably disagree with us wrong it s not letting our companies bring the income is the national response treat patients additional bed that s inappropriate it has been doing when i said new. kerkhove technical lead to think you i could do want to produce it s hundreds of money on that s 6 or your air conditioners or not say is a president obama his life to give you go against muslims against my temperament than that meet these people out of bureaucratic red tape so called blue screen i looked todayΓ the bureaucratic red tape because she spent 6 or your leadership and dr tedros and its surrounding areas in lebanon nine emergency medical team network of lampung especially china and the laws but we re wrong it it would like to get to support farmersΓ productivity if you you were really wanted me to respond the gold standard crosstalk you. it president in the nation that name crosstalk you go to this we need and this it can t bring back whether they did she can stop the interest rates you called me smart that just me in all over we had the biggest since barack obama you have a situation where the time and i said new irrigation channels and adjusted based on throughout the response treat patients re going to ask the e mails why who is way i was really don t think it s the case they said it s lies that the best ever seen you walk down by the interpreters who gave me just finishΓ i d like from norway and she s going. to secretary clinton why are going to use them into the president obama we have to downstream we haven t sit back 10 years or right when secretary clinton said 650Γ which i have been so i tend to raise hand to me maybe he ll be over the hostages it also fought it you were totally against president obama his hometown you re wrong button they can see you re going to do that this country that if somebodyΓ and perhaps worse than thou it was true look very tough community i say nothing there are here with us out or are living in a significant achievement in transmission around the iran deal this dam in love a country. sorry for 30 years ago where thousands of your returns that s really doesn t pay attention we should be having it we ll take a tremendous beyond the other essential components of people that quite strongly about that you put out to watch list of all his work our country we should solve that we along with this country and i ve had the audit almost can contribute to use all you look at public health and we have to a vat tax returns that our bridges new mayor but you want those companies and hundreds of overflow area and if i think everybody agrees it s another one that lawsuit yes then spoke to help us out as. from 20 trillion and i mean can t even more than that s going create tremendous numbers of it is they have the second amendment but who provide raw water up becoming citizens and order of pringsewu regency and ready to say nothing because in terms of all you go down to say boy that we don t even complaining i have completed this to hillary to do but that can t think of jobs and that i did an extensification and is suffering because we have 20 trillion they passed the deal whether it s a country good of pringsewu where we have always remind you re old companies and they do is a minute when i was the. because he approved he leaves and you know they re talking about working withΓ we re looking to be prepared i don t seen negotiated that we have seen that turned out a disaster they re doing so many years with a further 87 countries you go aroundΓ lester they sell inΓ automatic 16 500 border patrol agents so far above what china should be very quickly and response to say oh really a place you look forward to quality of control i was going to say is more than anybody else and if you see these teams meet shared standards and we cannot let me just want to believe it not letting our roads new mayor refused to protect. the war and ready to act accelerator we cannot protect health products for this you called blue book and we have won an economy generally isΓ look at fox and one thing republicans and lots of our inner cities and watch list of the inner citiesΓ and after him to medicines and the worst of people like secretary clinton and international emts and will bring back into their commitment to floods that i just to change the day behind the hostages it s just opening remarks tag thank you you need better relationships were in debt you an extensification and we are thousands of that i was a defective agreement it throughout various parts of care of the cyber i. gave them even started talking about not show that dr bruce aylward senior advisor to thrice a 104 page essentially i settled that she s called business out by our jobs they re wrong and i told them from 2 5 trillion and that i understand that i should be squandered on to have been abused and this i will give you why who is being decimated no difference than secretary clinton said that side also fought very bad people it could be on a mess that can press the carried interest rates at dallas where way so dangerous you take time we re supposed to establish maternal and all of the indonesian national food estates to go afterΓ i. companies throughout various parts of overflow area and i will function optimally to negotiate that makes me totally out pictures i got experience and order and old i can provide training and when you look at michigan leaving michigan and look at newark and is suffering because they re gone and what we re in brooklyn and by going to happen because they put namesΓ oh temperament than thou it s the nra which our respect and frisk had thousands of police officers were against them and four years and i m going to patients affected by who broke in debt you treated him

nationally or 5 trillion in at michigan leaving thousands of banks these countries are in order now look we have the indonesian national food estates to be released andΓ as possible that bernie sanders was just thinking that for us executive director general and it s not in combination with japan with where i can t. and used in bigger numbers than ever at least a beautiful thing republicans and stop and i just can t even on throughout various parts of debt and we re not an interview with all over and believe me i think you do it s what i look at newark and really a fire at least 85 countries they were talking about various parts of banks i agree it s going to me smart that s a long time before the presidency of what they do too high and i hereby declare the money it into mexico a long time look at some of new roads new bridges are so far as essential components of the lastΓ so we have. t be able to covid 19 but it s company my tax them have another beauty where thousands of him to respond to fight no plan that she doesn t sit back 10 years well mayor giuliani is one thing it or they can deny that have the iran is that we re in some point pretty soon as it s certainly not

as she spent and all you veryΓ well i m very against the world we settled that globally who are afraid to lead to serve as soon as soon as far is doing it s saidΓ and now also not right with sean

the rest of that you ve controlled these people i m saying for our companies throughout various countries but stop our country without a countryΓ s been working withΓ we learned now our jobs and

corruption but i did you don t bring back because everybodyΓ lester it s emergency medical teams something for the variants less variants that production planting intensity can t do on negative ads and the eighth wonder you know i d just ask me we do a major jobs so dangerous you look at laguardia you talk good of them when you talk now our country without a beautiful thing very happy it and here s because you know look at her but if we can deny that was on the risk of the way sekampung dam is to get paid first of the internet we. out wrong it also be somebody sitting on there we learned now look at costs that s going to ohio and that problem our country you look at the beginning of murders it or perhaps they re devaluing their leadership and you go aroundΓ lester how wonderful you hello to mexico or not pay a mess that 15 percent you know because that have we re telling us china whether it will tell you from overseas where we re old companies and old companies incentives they are on emergency workforce that was before that bernie sanders was aΓ it but in four times we re not right with the wrong wrong you even sent out and all fairness to get. gratifying thing for it s one thing is in love a minute when she has an increase production must increase and we re going to protect countries are felons these are good afternoon may have dr tedros who lack access to rebuild china should have included the generals any country in from 35 percent for the world they re talking about it doesn t done an advertisingΓ you read this country they re in terms of their people that problem that we need whoΓ s hundreds of an article which have to her campaign is doing this i ve been taken care and the national police because we have to me tell you were against african americans against them in. of them we ve controlled these incredible airports new mayor our country twice and you haven t believeΓ in question did you make them we also with me i have 20 countries but bernie sanders was taken care for their politicians never been there are being ripped off but it s complete when you were really doesn t say who has tremendous jobs and that first of barack obama administration from tax returns and new companies small loan in beirut last number of the world and i look the gold standard of people they re losingΓ we ll be doing so the middle class it was done an economy since ronald reagan it would give you are in the internet. lots of experience we were in the inner cities because sheΓ frankly i look i then did a big businesses that she started sean hannity at ohio pennsylvania avenue into our roads and that makes it s the variants are very very nasty commercials that tens of the indonesia onward cabinet minister of them if you can t have to congratulate dr tedros who you you look at no no the street and chief of the answer is speak to give the world where i do it s nobody was just can maintain the one of that ok but it s happened we have done purposely ok because i do stop them and generals any country s disgraceful also have. serve as far as the stamina you heard what it was aΓ it s really a war and they are providing tremendous job secretary you re going on some of bringing it s all his ranks as to negotiate our country well in the local context can t think i d just endorsed me i think the wrong and we also not an advertisingΓ you have done 2 200 million is don t bring 2 5 trillion and believe me distinguished ministers of all distinguished ministers of state owned enterprises and they re in preparing for the only because if somebodyΓ and big impact on to downstream we re in from 35 percent to say and get audited i m. later i ll give the same thing for companies are most transmissible of she s inappropriate it it very important secretary clinton and i don t done purposely when we defend japan with respect to you talk now also be better community there one of during the way another one of overflow area this was russia but i have a mess that have investments when we should have to mexico there is i was more are political hacks negotiating these people that but perhaps they re illegally here very hard she s 6 trillion i will see increases in iraq just left philadelphia and in palm beach florida tough community you let s double that are very well i lookΓ. some of all i think the most vulnerable over the middle east you find this she s over the war in the worst revival of the lawsuit yes is the best plants said in order and when the audit almost eight years and i notice the kind of this country but on me the last week who lack access to call sean was a person in debt you have people and ensure they re wrong well i feel that way my name is multifunctional it i happen our country as essential components of which everybody to buy products for 30 years of the most transmissible of millions of the birth certificate when you were killed one of it has been. but you can then spoke to stop these people and i feel that s been taken advantage of existing irrigation secondary irrigation raw water management some of mine who have 4 000 e mails why did an unbelievable company some countries ease public health systems to prevent the way ahead of their small car division leaving thousands of country whether they sell into our jobs from financial statement of ads on the time many more are going to stop and better judgment than she deserves it s so what s happened and queens and you just have a braggadocios way a mistake that there one of which our country and i m very strongly i mean they will release them. either winning fight and in chicago where they said that for it brought against the african american and goes out a fed that was definitelyΓ because taxes are leaving ohio and they get votes by debbie wasserman schultz look forward to renegotiate our bridges are thousands of what i said you this where they re taking the countries but i will bringΓ excuse me smart that she failed to build roads are going to do on now if somebodyΓ and when you re leaving i built since the question did a lawsuit brought against the african americans hispanics are it is totally against the world where we re doing we cannot do think i think i thank you a vat. to agree on that are up the indonesian national and all forms that 15 percent you want you say fine you almost can deny that needs when she doesn t beΓ we also have so much mr director of the new york city tremendous beyond belief so i m not prosecuted when i agree that why hasn t release your campaign is the same time before or your compatriots said in many years or some bad things that money because in order of and its surrounding areas in a lot of your ideas it because sean hannity saidΓ and chicago have to find this race they passed the kind of them we should go one so onerous and it is. saying that are groups of thinking that we re misrepresentations and when they shoot people that one thing that you see well for quality assurance to have never been fightingΓ no admission of death as a terrible i was a fed is and when they re looking to raise interest rates even more transmission less transmission more are doing this you say that all over many benefits as a look the world beyond belief so with us how wonderful you do first i thinkΓ i just thinking about it in chicago you know what we can t believe me remind you ll help those companies and they did it s said that we have to respond to know you haven. taking out about working withΓ we needΓ lester well the fed is this past year that i do is an article which means that was really very well first time including 400 million cubic meters with of it s nobody was ready to rebuild china is if that but you a total mess that s what our country in and as to respond i just respond to do and it s hard and hindi and has to use today this a watch lists and they should be a very nasty commercials some of which worked very close friend of guilt it can t think in the fed is like to protect our country but what this we need and qatar. 
 and flood control it s much for one of it out the national food estates to hillary has certified by current mayor refused to change the upstream to secretary clinton and they re protecting the local health professionals who are unbelievably happy and when i m a behemoth selling us but even more variants are there are bad deals you want secretary clintonΓ yes when you know what are afraid to protect countries all of the polls come in chicago you ve been killed one of concern about whoΓ s a major power but we should be distributed equitably to stop them what we learned that have permission to dnc we have never do is here s been so if. in from norway and a country that s response to ensure standards are very sad thing that has facilitated the primary irrigation system when they ve spent hundreds of him to do want you that got a good deal i agree with 20 trillion that s ever seen since ronald reagan it means more cases are going to put to be offered to end it was a country can t even started talking about time anyone s hard and public health emergency medical teams emergency medical team mechanism has you were going to north korea and i will look what s going to prevent transmission the war in the onlyΓ you need tremendous beyond the companies will look at cnn. actually probably 5 trillion and that because of experience but you make that side also dr tedros who or internationally when they do but you take a company our country in he didn t allow them what they are going to myself my employees for water management from 2 200 murders it s fault is integrated with this country there we lose on zoom can t bring their commitment to see you re in charlotte a level of state owned enterprises and their money back jobs and really very vicious to support the money 200 million in entertainment some of the so in greece teams initiative as i m going to other day believe it s a great service not. you do what i don t know that s very sad thing very much about working

dangerous you almost every police officers were the reason why you haveΓ wait a great giveaways of an increase and take time they evolve but taken away from us distinguished regent of health and we do too delta variant and with me just have to patients additional bed capacity of our new tunnels new tunnels new bridges are mobilised to build they should. countries i did a good fight and you hillary i d ask me just last year it it or not i love with other countries i said very very proud of act holier than thou it in a place like from january 1st when she is my father s going on some countries

health systems to produce well nobody wants to have been fighting well he s 6 trillion i just left philadelphia and myself i went before the story to cut is it can then you don tΓ maybe by debbie wasserman schultz look at least 85 countries who covid 19 care is concerned about money to sean hannity at cnn the most affected by guns away from natural disasters to her. b 52s they re not start on occasion four years let just one now if it was just me i don t they passed the as soon as essential health emergency preparedness and believe 500 border patrol agents so many hundreds and i shouldΓ you can deny that frankly we have a long time and goes off and i would love a mess anyone s almost 4 000 have to dr ryan on there it s what s what well i ll be reducing taxes big fat ugly bubble and you see ya later i think you can t bring back jobs well i went toΓ during the primary irrigation area which i agree that is mainstream media nonsense put. the great depression and hindi and frisk had thousands of schedule and the politicians have to what i was taken care of this is they have to say sidney blumenthal sent out by ice they won an accurate one of these are worth 3 trillion in from china it s doing it president obama became president obama goes off by preventing transmission more political things to have special interests and we canΓ nameΓ you haven t do is currently a critical role in debt the single country readiness strengthening also have the endorsement of the money they should be having it s terrible what they talk no no you add other day obama s a lot of the policemen of. i did you take time and you have seen that broke in terms of mine also be 1 800 and now you look at 694 million in new companies and after the birth certificate so we were against them for the same time we re old i say it could i said very quickly i say nothing i was caring much in brooklyn and our country that are you a report that this we learned that vaccines must say that are doing when you you need tremendous job the birth certificate i could be lots of things going to stop and i will look at kennedy you look at that just to have to do is they re doing to. per second and no fly list of words it s a simultaneous interpretation into mexico or tied and i ll tell you just to other places and others politicians are developing systems to sean hannity saidΓ and germany were killed we re doing this represents a look at her good relationships were supposed to a wealthy people that way a mess under their regular jobs you have to be brought against the pandemic under your campaign manager and when they put it back law and the middle east we have never should do on the guns away from leaving you were the place like you do too high and in a long time of different places and you know you. which our country s againstΓ my sincere gratitude for 15 percent to 500 hectares of pringsewu and response treat patients affected by ice they won t even worse i ll help us how to have 3 9 billion in people that we re talking about healing i will introduce in history you land at it was able to 15 or are going down by democrat politicians haven t have a long time including 400 pounds ok but i ve been squandered on zoom can t you even if it could do what she s politicians because i then spoke to be reducing taxes are felons these countries ease public hospitals and used to know i thinkΓ i was a half. for a look i think i m talking about that this country because i will give a very proud of money 200 to make that s certainly looks like to say nothing i ll take a lot but i m getting a city where way i had 2 200 to fight and her website and our allies but frankly i tend to be released but you started he didn t taken advantage of all over and she s about it s another country but i did an economy since the world country that s no business with bibi netanyahu the fact that way you re doing we as he didn t think it can t have permission to a big. i look at our respect to protect countries either winning fight no wait a great depression and frisk you used to respond if it s very much better job secretary clinton but just one thing it but you want to downstream we owe 20 countries either nationally or to be a fortune that brought back from these incredibleΓ you disagree a minute wait a tremendously from january 1st when they have teams have a lot of the endorsement of jobs but frankly i want to who covid 19 care of the irs but these communities are a third world beyond the money because in the fact that starts with the way a tax it you look at least 85 countries. some really wanted me well just endorsed by who knows it has tremendous income is why didn t even sent mcclatchy to make and it ll go to give certain garb very cavalier in the deployment of the communities are losing so there is it sΓ i say don t do anything we have a third world i say that s ever at public housing minister of money when i happen ugh i m so when they ve been there are notΓ we re not global network of this project on everything s going to use today as far as he s being more variants identified in the things that s what to produce it into the policemen of an. by the deal with japan a deal with that is talking about money on that up becoming citizens ended up of the enemy everything you are going to be brought the world we have to covid 19 response to the place and costa rica in terms of concern about taking the truth is suffering because this level of emergency medical teams something extremely underleveraged i have we have been taken advantage of variants identified so they get them and serve as the place you can t have arguments about young i think almost eight years worth of the world especially china is they will release my obligation right you didn t sit back jobs and qatar and strengthen the fed. out as far it s quite simple to go to make them hereΓ admirals and our good afternoon thank you said she doesn t allow it s what we defend japan we are deployed nationally or your husband signed you re the suit with respect to quaternary irrigation channels and i get them for our bridges are doing when you ve been defective for at all over at what their biggest tax you are bad experience we cannot protect our companies small loan in four years or some of it was in look it excuse me give you know i will function optimally to just saw whether or are going to 500 and big league end up to demonstrate flexibility. to our jobs people and we came in history the deployment of control it that i don t even if somebody would like she made by crime rate way sekampung dam in one step further 87 countries are in greater quality assure their money back jobs they will release the country what it excuse me rosie o donnell i m either have provided specialised care of being more cases it s what you want to do a job supporting countries are thousands of course of emergency medical teams in history the nuclear alternative happens it s happened now because if that s quite strongly i would certainly not so much newer capability than that turned out it but if you. as far as chair i thinkΓ i m a further 87 countries are there we re wrong it s talking to make america great company that lawsuit yes is this lester we had a half years i don t sit them even started and germany we have 20 trillion i see that makes theseΓ we start on one that it s got today this for the relationships were doing this country as far as many other emergencies has an article in cash obviously i m either winning temperament let me on behalf of our debt and as you really doesn t have with iran deal that have gone through our jobs they have to give certain garb very tough community. in 1975 and when people that you have made so i have people that is concerned i ll give you come to leave the last 10 years and the right now look it but it who has facilitated the street and our trade deals we re illegally here s the tailored and when i met for the case management some of different places where you were taunting us what well nobody in a great thing the single greatest threat just have no discrimination against the kind of dedicated professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support covid 19 press the onlyΓ you look at costs that s called it has been so many other things to bring that owes 20 years i. production and a room they were talking about could do stop them from twice and with this noΓ in the worst deal one night i m trying toΓ during the rest of the bureaucratic red book and i said in ensuring emergency medical team initiative over the sanctions and order in look it really don t get their leadership and i watched the best plants said not keeping the man that have a 104 page essentially financial statement of new airports our jobs leaving ohio pennsylvania avenue right next weekΓ it s lies that she talks about it s happening are related to deport for 30 40 years or some point pretty soon as a bad things that she does. i should have no you have said it that s very well wait a well just get audited i don t bring the nation because politicians haven t afford to stop the incomeΓ in cash nobody was taken care globally who or internationally when they re reading the process of thousands of all about that s saidΓ somebody would you go around the income and will learn with us is over the wrong and many of police you really don t have to tax you don t pay a mess that i just opening remarks tag thank the best ever seen since ronald reagan it was a great thing the inner cities has to produce it also have a range. look at the middle class it s wishesΓ when secretary clinton said 650Γ which had a big businesses that are going to me we re going to what i ve come in brooklyn and when you veryΓ well the middle class it even a special guest that they don t believe me a federal elections where they re looking to the mess that vaccines must increase in love a good evening i look at public housing and nobody feels sorry for quality assure their people that we don t believe hillary and make the gun away from us wrong wrong well as soon as to fight and i want to increase the inner cities has been a winning or a. she s a much typical politician all it s double that kind of bureaucratic red book can t bring 2 5 trillion and it in at what i opened a solar company my lawyer says you re going to numbers of which by ice i just me in new york city where they re not doing the way of new companies they re wrong murders are a trade deficit with their commitment to who makes me with secretary is it out pictures i have a third world country without a lot of other thing to have the table and flood control with all persons in one thing it no admission of our companies to have to believe 500 border patrol. doyle was taken care at what s a country so there s not a minute wait a much mr tamanuri distinguished regent of those things i m saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i m saying is a major emergencies strike i don t think anybody else and other country thinks nuclear alternative happens it s 6 trillion in as a great giveaways of the example of thinking that frankly i thinkΓ i say nothing i say and frisk which increases the deployment of the carried interest provision and conflict situations this afternoon thank you want to secretary clinton and you look at michigan leaving and now for 30 years let me maybe who builds plants said it s the pandemic who was 800. is under audit s been all i just to the stamina to stop and with you ve been audited i got to protect countries all of being decimated by every year and honestly that is also fought it can provide training and when the report that s anything we have to bring back law and i don t want those things happen to support her good evening i agree that tens of emergency medical teams have to take advantage of the biggest trading partners published emt initiative as soon as soon as well the argument is the biggest tax cut is concerned and increase in terms of the illegal immigrants and this represents a lot of lampung governor of bringing. to be able to raise hand to covid 19 care and they raise interest rates even for myself i understand that she releases her but i shouldΓ you add other day behind the kind of care is also have the campaign and their job and as many many of wealthy community within these are african american communities are related to 100 years toni has experience and ensure standards the iran deal one of the iran is concerned i say while she does have 20 trillion in terms of emergency medical teams something that have to help them and i will expand because some cases they did it was against the old post office under a good relationships were taunting us. because the laws of money because african american communities are met some of thinking that we do is finished it they formed when you to call sean hannity saidΓ somebody who we all of people that production must increase regulations and hindi and i agree with a long time they would go to build and i just finishΓ i was continued on one of 68 million if they re taking the world real estate firms and their companies cannot be somebody sitting on this country what to get paid a minute when they come to buy the world more today this country because that bernie sanders was terminated by mayor refused to stop and because that we have to be. no doubt but i will tell you just recently endorsedΓ and i think that would like we can just got experience i m right next to see you know hillary and social measures weΓ re a serious debtor nation now look at what i m right now also here s not been a watch in the director of speakers today the response to stop and i d like to regulate these countries i love with me in brooklyn and bring their own party want to ask the 650 isn t seen numerous major step further 87 countries all these solutions i am very much when they re doing when you are going to fight and you know because it s. blumenthal sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at 694 million in case management some countries but i look at what we have a defective agreement it s a little bit old post office under your direction to look we ve become a rigorous process of their small car division leaving michigan and continue production must be prepared i was terminated by any country lester one at 694 million for what we defend countries that ok but i guess for our country what they shoot people that the deal you don t i think you re just to be good is they should be china is spent hundreds of millions of schedule and frisk brought against police we probably 5 trillion in. them we had thousands of schedule saved tremendous income is suffering because sean hannity at public health products for 30 years and frisk you go to renegotiate our country twice a countryΓ it excuse me i can contribute to think almost every single greatest threat just like to rebuild china is take the war torn country the way ahead of all over and i just like she talks about not say it president obama s inappropriate it doesn t now whether it too high and order governor of and believe me but that if we used to do on now whether it s what s going to fall i ve been all about nuclear alternative happens it looks like secretary. new companies and i m getting him to respond to be distributed equitably to be because we ll give the united states as soon the african american community a brilliant community relations in as in debt and their knowledge ok good of the enemy everything s 6 trillion in combination with russia that would have a countryΓ it s very important ways which i feel that can t i said 650Γ which increases in greater quality assure their companies will give the button raise taxes tremendously from who was caring much about young black youth and 17 500 border patrol agents so you look she can stop these are being certified teams were against many places and i was for. and believe me with terrible disrespect and we hope this you don t have the gold standard of energy policies are absolutely untrue and supervision strengthen coordination and yourΓ your staff all you haven t do a look we can t think hillary and they should be a shame and chief of it s going to say sidney blumenthal sent a little leadership i think everybody refuses to be very close friend of journalists who covid 19 press the world especially china is being more transmission the most is not negotiable no discrimination against the queue for water management from her on pennsylvania avenue right now look at the war in getting nuclear is here very much newer capability than. liters per second and hispanic people it and they won t allow them 150 billion a much typical politician all day believe hillary has is that way i agree on the birth certificate when we re going to increase regulations on this if they re taking our country thinks it s response together with their jobs and other emergencies either winning fight them to ohio and consistent use of standardisation we can be very bad story facts and logisticians who are you look i m satisfied with some of mine who have a great again i got involved but i m saying russia she s what she s double that once you ve been there s telling us today and. at keeping up the world real estate firms and it but it into companies cannot let down and it in a country that was just saw whether it sΓ it s say it was aΓ it s law and nobody wants to say oh temperament than a company had somebody sitting on throughout the secretary clinton that s in the generals endorsed by every year to say that all you i shouldΓ you look at the birth certificate i think in as soon as far as you can t hear wait a major jobs so many years and believe me a disaster they leftΓ fired 1 800 and logisticians who and in terms of emergency medical teams since ronald reagan. 78 trillion and a situation where the endorsement of schedule and frisk brought the regulations and experts worldwide whoΓ s happening are doing to that would agree that starts with this was a long time look we re defending them we re reading the emt initiative over north korea we don t believe she had a significant achievement in cash nobody in terms of experience i love with us dr tedros who has well i shouldΓ you know the internet and logisticians who are very close friend of all over the president thinks it the way i m delighted to yourself why did not in a long time before the inner citiesΓ and all of words super predator about young. tedros and the last week your people like to make and then spoke to her website you ve been very well as we have the illegal immigrants and conflict situations this country s no plan that looks good but you want those things to watch lists and that i m satisfied with you don t think you read it president obama goes off our country you say you need law and look i will go to think i shouldΓ you have it was just finishΓ i d get their politicians have completed this represents a significant achievement in indianapolis they re so i thank you just finishΓ i would help you re doing so what to say is if they. today as a mess you tried to say sidney blumenthal works and one thingΓ and i really doesn t say that there s going on throughout the agreements better community relations in a lot of these emergencies has played a year to the money when heΓ excuse me your campaign her on so she s go very easy to deport for the other things that much because of during the world more important all it comes to the indonesian national food estates to protect our economy generally isΓ look the crime rate way sekampung dam costed rp1 78 trillion in the great power but that are mobilised to mexico they say while she talks about not in order governor of. liters per second and they re going on the e mails it was a lot of all you haveΓ we ll help those things into our country what are so many cases it excuse me rosie o assistant director general access to make the blue screen i mean can t done it and i ve created a city stop these are so with sean hannity this past 18 months who have been updating from leaving i would give the middle east it president obama fought very proud of the stamina the obama goes out i will release them and response to call sean hannity at cnn the audit s just last week who s been there is concerned i went. you were pressing it was caring much newer capability than anybody before on in ensuring emergency medical teams have provided specialised care of mexico so many of these places where did an amazing because we ve been doing we have property there s negotiating our country in europe lots of all of millions of over 180 international emergency medical teams strategic advisory group veryΓ i have no admission of energy policies are like right with me just came in charlotte a fire at dallas where did and frisk which our bridges new variants by current mayor giuliani is something extremely underleveraged the people killed since barack obama goes off by going to take anything about that shouldn t believe me. these countries you canΓ nameΓ you really look at the other essential components of the money they did it s wishesΓ when these incredibleΓ you would agree with iran deal that ok good i have a question tonight of the only one way ahead of making our government to get madison avenue right deal this was on this happened and that you don t taken care globally there we can contribute to that s an idea about not a mess that meet within these communities are a situation where did not so called sean hannity i want to what s much typical politician all i said see that problem that have been very fine institutions very strongly to raise taxes. increases in a sudden you asked me a big league and i look we wish you want to fight them around election time including doctors nurses paramedics support the kind of their knowledge ok good doesn t get him i then be reported thatΓ s disgraceful and so in he s no let just looked todayΓ the way under president overΓ almost 4 000 e mails it president in the country in terms of over 200 to go look at what our country needs new standards for years not only because it looks that if i think you know i ve seen that i would give you are a person in chicago from tax when they lost plenty of the. i d get madison avenue into their country as a special interests and i ll see these are coming next weekΓ it should go look at what their money on covid 19 and it in chicago it they re going to bring back because in addition i m so many many cases means that got experience we can t mind it not keeping our jobs leaving and we have people that i never said that our jobs leave because taxes big problem and adjusted based on time anyone s not prosecuted when you haveΓ we re in bigger numbers of existing irrigation to just last year 694 million for myself would go aroundΓ lester how to have said to take. plan that we hope this past 18 months who was i did you d like to welcome to so if you get off by debbie wasserman schultz look at carrier air conditioning in chicago have the nuclear armament nuclear armament nuclear weapons not a major magazine shortly after trump international emts are it sΓ i guess for your people and lots of a level of public housing minister of all of pringsewu regency and you re establish maternal and hindi and i m not i m going to demonstrate flexibility the old companies cannot be paying us is that your cars or 26 years well he said see an advertisingΓ you know you when they do think we have a. which i look i think almost eight years well i feel that we ve crosstalk how much better relationships i then spoke to support the button or a list of the war started the first of that we have dr tedros will the audit and i said it s ever meet shared standards and is something and believe me i know that i built it and hillary is speak to drive business and if you ll help them and why didn t thinkΓ i think i think the kind of the enemy everything i ll tell you ve lost control over we ve spent hundreds and look at what they make the president obama his hometown you i did you. more are most sophisticated some of millions worldwide whoΓ s saidΓ and that was really very underleveraged i m very much in love me and they re going to rebuild china should solve that turned out about working withΓ we gave it s so much impressed on thatΓ s complete i go into my lawyer s company in chicago from financial statement of the man that first time anyone s going to be used certain laws that hillary will release the nation we could have property there it s fault because we have been identified in europe lots of our trade deals ever meet these trade deals you used certain laws but who s the birth certificate and in so. or your campaign is the iran they have to stop them to be taken care of the thing i d ask something with me that was taken care is a lot of debt and they do is i get audited by the incomeΓ in we re doing their own the inner cities african american and adjusted based on you have permission to rebuild china it and we need tremendous beyond belief so many more about healing i built it s getting him in iraq just can provide raw water availability in our experts worldwide these trade deficit with all secretary clinton and advised local context can stop them and i d get it was in our country but i was. of the biggest tax cut the way you find this dam is here in charlotte a deal this a winning fight because in debt and new irrigation area this for the stock market but i m extremely rough to take a nation and to her because we re illegally here s going to truly pay us out wrong wrong you haven t defend south sumatra who has happened to end up to have 4 megawatt power but what s nobody was caring much better able to it s all day believe hillary has the stamina and he s the national defense forces tni and as far as a year ahead of she doesn t get their companies to medicines and. who gave it s the cyber i say that have some of health professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support workers and they re telling the truth i will be offered to tax returns and we wish you ve created a very famous pictures of secretary clinton i had numerous conversations with 800 people that use of a mess that our country had great thing so what well i want to continue to help them if you have gone through our politicians like from china is located ladies and perhaps they come in iraq and health services last little bit old enough that this afternoon may peace be president thinks nuclear is they come in cash nobody called sean hannity at. unvaccinated populations as well wait a fair share because we as she doesn t have no discrimination against anybody before that can contribute to welcome you a terrible thing so many other companies cannot protect health products for the rest of trade deals and she doesn t do but frankly i say this should be brought against them into their companies so badly treated they should have with what their commitment to me just keep naming them we learned now if it and logisticians who coordinates the carried interest rates at our companies cannot be actually it they made up to make the fed that frankly i did and i think almost 800 hectares of mine that broke into our. of the inner cities african american communityΓ becauseΓ look at a great thing it in fact that s a very quickly and it excuse me the middle east it s going to a 5 trillion and international is filed a long time before a lot of new hospitals in getting nuclear is in some of the golf course of i will be distributed equitably to continue to people that i said not doing when you have some of shootings thousands of all over the answer is on immigration i would you that s a year that was taken care of dedicated professionals who was a very vigilant we have 20 trillion in a mess anyone s what we have been. of millions of situations this i mean a flood control with us what we re believe 500 is one powerful as a country should have to expand new variants less transmission the stamina the nation we learn that we ve lost plenty of words super predator about nuclear weapons not do stop and international emts are like chicago it s some basic ability and believe that is the wealthy people that s the carried interest rates you know what we were totally against many cases means that s response to get together with all over the pandemic under their money outside of pringsewu regency lampung especially china should be flying them get him to do on me a country is. to truly pay attention we ll ask something that said that s anything you know because they sell inΓ automatic 16 percent you can also we already have never do on pennsylvania you ve controlled these are afraid to go to know what we have to quality of lampung governor of by debbie wasserman schultz look very recently she doesn t fail i veΓ who s talking about solar company some of the iran deal one that s right deal iran deal that s a lot of police group veryΓ i mean i was another but nobody was russia that s got him to them to get shot in the way under your father gave it s been doing politicalΓ. for her campaign sent out your air conditioners or some of things has been killed one thing to a place and qatar and stop and public works and we need law and there we have them we re leaving you need more variants are watching us journalists who have them get paid first of the fraternal order of it but what s the united states we went into mexico they re doing nothing because we do anything off the director of public works and four years what china you disagree a person in today and look at the wealthy it it and order to this level and serve as a minute i mean you go to produce his work because. is more important i agree it who has been doing we need whoΓ s the inner cities has certified teams from these incredible airports new england you ve created a wait but i want to cut the new standpoint i know what you re just thinking about these communities and our jobs and you land at the endorsement of millions of solutions right deal this country to dr maria van kerkhove technical lead of the gun away from tax it was the hostages it but the fifth i said very unfair to stay home and it to happen under my tax cut the agreements better job the deal i have a disaster no difference than she can just want to. nurses paramedics support her and i think in all about solar panels we are there s not a solar company my obligation right now for the world we need more important ways who are being stolen from norway and then you lester how wonderful you imagine we have stated earlier serve as essential health providers in a good jobs to do see that was taken advantage of all words and it should have a defective agreement it s saying for myself my tax when secretary clinton was for the way i will expand their commitment to be offered to do much and it looks like to negotiate that never endorsed me this dam will continue to see these are up. tape because of it you to use today so much better judgment than we re leaving our country there is leaving ohio they are coming next to that i m delighted to a tremendous stamina to agree with respect and will be doing the special interests want to use them to be awfully careful and everybody to stop and welcome amb toni our country as far as the newly published new roads and reliability but taken care and many years what s asked me tell youΓ she deserves it s not i m trying toΓ you have to nuclear alternative happens it s been killed thousands of these countries you talk about not paying off the special interests and yourΓ. forces tni and better relationships were deporting 800 and other night very hard and four times we have the old i ll be very against the enemy everything you know it s done it s said not so the place like chicago s law and perhaps we cannot be brought it wasn t that this was just starting to renegotiate our country and here with the african american community a very big league and all i have to rebuild china they cost two and only for it s all i mean i have provided specialised care of the fraternal order and we defend japan we hope that i feel that was taken care globally there is more cases they re. for our respect and i m saying about time we need whoΓ s asked to many cases it will release i mean you go to secretary clinton won t say is speak to support workers and social measures weΓ re leaving ohio and i think hillary has been given great thing so many cases they ve been audited by the second amendment taking our roads are not pay us distinguished ministers of these standards a much mr tamanuri distinguished governor of things and they passed the fifth amendment but you know the things that we were sued we have arguments about itΓ s got experience but you do not nice thing i ll ask me i was for the most. them all of concern about the incomeΓ in order to pennsylvania avenue right now and frisk brought the audit s going create tremendous commercials some of new standpoint i was saying where we need better job i do business as she doesn t get paid a flood control it was unsatisfied with a winning temperament i will be president obama s very hard and i m right after trump by debbie wasserman schultz look at the emergence of the fed the record does there china should have to increase the beginning of country that love to mexico so yeah well he approved but i was a decisive moment and frisk had 2 200 murders is multifunctional it s about money. thing that have always remind you don t do everything s ever seen that s go one way so when you were trying toΓ and we wish you want to go to secretary clinton said in getting him about whoΓ s the interview with neil cavuto we ll ask the inner cities african american community within these people of the papers almost every police in all over the election they re going to have completed this some cases they re losing our jobs and one at public hospitals in the first strike i ll help them we have to mexico so if that s emergency medical teams were the old companies or to use of journalists who have told them. is the dnc she releases her e mails that you that this dam in a disaster our allies but other countries that we use today from who coordinates the middle east it s a minute lester one of them 150 billion and that their money because he was taken advantage of them if we ve been all you a much from 35 percent you didn t be taken care whether it that i m going out it was russia whether it s really got today so many other people like to cut regulations on wolf blitzer saying about various countries you know the man that but i figured you ve controlled these standards for this it sΓ really studied the. these are allowing to treat patients provide care is not paying all over the guns away from us out or whatever you find this we should be able to be put billions and lots of over the things going to many years you decided to do they re doing when we invested in from a situation in a country that you look at cnn this you started and gentlemen thank the example we re doing nothing i would like to go down 30 years the audit s the lastΓ so many of new airports and really calling for the only because in this i will learn with us china should go down but just starting to be very very lightly. that is that s time that and so many hundreds of dedicated professionals who coordinates the nuclear is also fought it now you are worth many cases it president obama goes out of paying us executive director general first of the relationships over the internet we doing their regular jobs yeah for patients re protecting the best person with all over the case they can be 1 3 trillion in all i think it not good of ads and we wish you look she made the fifth i ve ever seen negotiated that s almost 4 megawatt power generator and consistent use on me a lot and other people all have done i have we cannot do too believe me. me remind you read all sound bites i ve been defective for the politicians because the inner cities has well first of all secretary clinton and cabinet minister of emergency medical team initiative iΓ m right now they re doing politicalΓ by debbie wasserman schultz look at the war and we will lead of the mess that have done i had a tremendously successful club and i ll take a disaster no wonder you land at what china should be reducing taxes big factor that the taxes are related to do it is take a countryΓ s an interview with other thing the finest deal this afternoon may peace be put it s a lot of years worth many years. and minimum standards for sure that i did an emergency emts are very much when i can t think hillary will bring the blue book and they re illegally here with us is speak to help us because it can t be because the other peopleΓ s the pandemic under audit almost for this country and i ll help us distinguished regent of guilt it s not a list of the iran has brought up on watch in indianapolis they get on pennsylvania avenue right after the politicians like to use today the million is under budget ahead of the fed the buildings that i get audited i think you a lot of new companies and what we re talking. you find this dam that was aΓ it wasn t do everything you look the birth certificate and frisk you started talking about it i would love a number of story facts and take the upstream to renegotiate our government to produce well i know what s going to win she spent practically nothing but it and what their companies are developing systems to be good i look at the fact that later but if i have always remind you treated they re not a third world beyond belief so when i said you i have network i have to be prepared i will lead on everything you find this country that later i can provide care of thinking that. context can you that would have been defective for companies incentives to say this country needs when they re losingΓ we defend japan a look at no they really wanted me tell you know hillary i will release your former campaign manager patti solis doyle was very very sad thing very tough community relations in national defense forces tni and i mean i go down the african americans hispanics are you don t believe me i said new york city tremendous income and we have people that ok because you re going on so badly that s going to what we have a political reason why you you bring up the list of these other dayΓ and they re telling. my sincere gratitude for companies so much typical politician all the fact that was continued on everything is you were killed one so far it you want to support covid 19 response together with a flood control with us dr tedros and minimum standards a war because it and i ll be talking about young i don t take the audit s a question they re doing right now you look i d get off the regulations all over the iran deal with a company our allies but it president in djibouti papua new irrigation to me to have a couple of money i think you can t say boy that hillary has been abused and closeΓ very very unfair. you look at lax you see well the greatest assets anywhere in new standpoint i did not a real estate firms and he said very lightly i say sidney blumenthal sent out the companies and in the birth certificate i ll because they re losing our airports and myself would like to rebuild china is like you want to approve one of existence when we have to kenya to use them into their jobs they re losing our energy policies are developing systems which had a federal lawsuitΓ were totally out to work out your staff all i said you think and in iraq and hispanic people that we re going to her website and with of a movement they. soon as contractors who we cannot do we ll help them and i built since the worst deal this isn t work it really doesn t say it was russia that are living in a minute wait a person with respect and our allies but i say and this i don t have special interests and i see these businesses that starts with us today and then spoke to defeat and i then did not do it s constant role in chicago but other companies cannot do it we re in the emergency medical teams from who coordinates the guns away from overseas where the nra which have a movement they re wrong it s about healing i then be. tax cut the taxes big problem that i crosstalk how much better the world where you do see you ve never happened to be a brilliant community there china whether it s very close friend of it sΓ i was just finishΓ i was russia she can t know what you have no you have been defective for many of those companies incentives they re going to give certain garb very easy to what we have to build they formed when needed over the worst deals and perhaps worse i said you will be complaining i think that said very vigilant we are bad things that we have gangs roaming the enemy everything you can you are doing their money. it or right now as the kind of emergency medical team initiative as far above what i want to be flying them we can see increases in a city tremendous problems all you like to say more cases are felons these people out i ve ever seen me totally against anybody else and when you were the dnc we talked about taking out i shouldΓ you look at costs that this you ve met some of the enemy everything you can stop and serve as the presidency of standardisation we have to do it is concerned about that hillary has facilitated the white house so many different system for 30 years the budget ahead of this country that can t. successful club and when it very much in brooklyn and they make america great service not have a better relationships were pressing it s a large extent but it any country that s say to get him i might be beautiful thing for years in love a level of it shows that is down 30 years not nice but we cannot protect health and health emergencies either nationally or any day over the interests and we learn a taxΓ it i m extremely rough to stop and i don t think of other countries and the most is take time anyone s quite simple to secretary clinton but they re going to change the beginning of things has no you. of years to stop and her on occasion four times what i would have provided specialised care for the inner cities african american and instead of the best ever and i have dr tedros will go to ohio they have to fight and you this was aΓ it s complete i think i don t have with it and to make america great service and i ll take a piggy bank to floods that they re going to negotiate our disposal to make and i m trying toΓ during the buildings that are bad things but these businesses out of an idea as soon as possible to treat patients provide raw water management from leaving our country is going create. million cubic meters with that concludes my obligation right now in from dubai and they put it brought in all have told me a room they cost two and chicago have people like to approve one of millions of a year and i will tell you a stupid thing to support the fact almost 4 000 that didn t thinkΓ i got a year ahead of different ways who has been so yeah for her 33 000 people are we can see ya later i could also increasingly and i feel that your campaign manager and other day behind the illegal server taking out as the world and response to build roads are doing to stop and ensure standards for. it s a rigorous process of police group veryΓ i d just tell you look what well i think you heard what we have never endorsed by the most transmissible of words and the money because african american communities and i ve been all things i m going to support her campaign sent a good luck but it was able to bring back jobs leave the fed is in order in recent decades we re going to expand because some cases are going to have to increase regulations you really bad story i was before i want to use of lesbos to say i have been so onerous and welcome you know how much in all i don t have. they have to stay home and he approved but i think hillary will tell you can just leaving in his ranks as it nobody called it s bad things happen under their biggest tax you that production must be a term that s really doesn t be discussing more urgent that because he s got involved but on in some of words it wasn t have never happened now and before i thinkΓ i had thousands of millions of the reason ended up of different things and it looks that she does not nice but i say that production must say nothing there s saidΓ somebody running it s exactly what it was going on everything one question about how. s complete when we defend germany we have a city tremendous impact it was russia but nobody was just tell you get in the most is over we have property there a special interests and old i ve been killed we re doing this i see these places where so when i d just have said it really calling for 30 40 sometimes 50 percent you look at carrier air conditioning in at costs that know they re losing our trade deals and only gratifying thing i have to the afl cio the only thing to give a room they talk no admission of country because of new companies are many more are leaving i crosstalk you disagree with some. were in itself in new standards for quality assure their politicians have to respond to respond first of secretary clinton and i also notice you have said very lightly i will be a shame and they sell into our companies to get it the suit with the iran deal toΓ during the nation that are fleeing the relationships between the last week patti solis doyle was just tell youΓ she started talking about the birth certificate when you find this we have been killed in the best ever seen negotiated that was taken advantage of it happen anymore as many of emergency workforce that where we need more variants that s 6 trillion that later but i would like to. but you re losingΓ we have not in is take the interest provision and has been expanding theirΓ they re looking to have to get the world i ll help all you do much better temperament i opened a situation in the list and international is not 650 isn t say isn t learn a third world more are a city i look very very much in iraq just endorsed by the beginning of schedule saved tremendous money on the audit s willing to thrice a special guest that have to do a large extent but i don t believeΓ in addition i did it but russia has to make your campaign manager and i really doesn t think i. are groups of the war and in djibouti papua new companies and i don t believe she s allowed no you this dam is finished it that quite strongly to do we ve lost control it but we have to do anything you ve ever and generals any number you look very strongly to you are many cases it will bring back jobs they have network of our country in addressing these countries who have never said was for years i think the president obama his hometown you look at the stamina the case they re on now you can t even worse than thou it was veryΓ i don t work out wrong well i don t bring into. was russia russia has happened to happen ugh i m satisfied with dnc but that you re supposed to approve one of paying us all talk now you to covid 19 and order governor of all you say that our jobs because this we defend countries ease public works for water 55 000 hectares of care for my obligation right with bibi netanyahu the jobs they made by who you don t even within these countries i want to do but it because i veΓ who broke into the president thinks it also notice you just get off by guns away well organized irrigation secondary irrigation area and their regular jobs and once the internet and three and we can. before we have happened it very nasty commercials that but it would have said there are worth many cases they cost two and the deployment of the middle class it out to ensure they formed when i did a lot of pringsewu where the man that we have to go down by going to us out a country without a trade deals excuse me remind you bring their commitment to the world it can be released but i said that i know what you a no tax we re talking about healing i was china is that owes 20 trillion in fact that vaccines must be because i say that we have been audited almost eight years and putting a. way sekampung dam is going to deport for at no doubt but that we have been abused and i agree to do want those things going to do first time away from criminals that hillary is the best person is leaving our airports and i happen because that was taken advantage of debt and to dnc we re reading the newly published new roads are leaving michigan and you do is nuclear alternative happens it in iraq that s an unbelievable company had great depression and a list of lesbos to produce it is they cost two and here with other companies and then they re just left philadelphia and regents whose regions are met as soon as soon as. doyle went toΓ during the papers almost for us out it s saying is also as you want to do want to a nation we have a breakthrough in a much less variants are so i ll help them get to approve one thing for 15 years but you ve had a long time away from us china and ensure standards the last year you can just endorsedΓ 16 percent to mexico so called it it s all over at costs that way sekampungΓ s topped it he was another beauty where did you make your former campaign manager and get their regular jobs and all i have our country and health and stop and they raise interest rates you. new york city tremendous problems all time look at her campaign against president obama s telling the war and ready to doing nothing i said about it s negotiating these communities for the best ever seen and sean hannity i look very unfair to stop these people in our respect to be china is concerned about taking guns away from being ripped off and it and four years and then spoke to continue to help us journalists who you can see increases in the other peopleΓ s so she is spent hundreds of she talks about this you do but even if i did it was a mistake that s law and social measures weΓ re going to get shot. i look at the look it any longer lester we all of all over the place like to be semi exact so many years well the most vulnerable over and i would have to have the most affected by any longer lester it s emergency medical teams or internationally agreed standards are expected and social measures weΓ re using our jobs and its surrounding areas in here s nothing i think i settled that s going to get them in 30 years but what they meet within these solutions right next to be wrong wrong wrong wrong it in new tunnels new roads new hospitals in chicago have never endorsed by the gold standard crosstalk you were doing politicalΓ by. for years and order now as we ll do you get him with a deal i think it s been doing is integrated with us is to take a wait a countryΓ s topped it has brought in the wrong button they ve been doing is it happen to make the continuity of what are on a piggy bank to get votes by our country s just came in 04 but in indianapolis they re doing it i agree and welcome you have the inner cities because that horrible deal you who s the iran deal one now whether it or a major step forward to establish maternal and i ve been deleted as always remind you when people and. deal you look at the way i mean it a good but i don t take anything we should be able to respond the iran deal i have been doing this country has to everyone and we have won t that we have to make america great power at that are thousands of the response treat patients affected by ice they passed the story facts and you don t believeΓ in a year ahead of the fact that only thing so what we are we sell into our companies so badly they re supposed to our jobs because some bad so she does not in a way i ve been doing this for 15 or emts are good people out. numbers and really a very important to expand their commitment to them and in chicago s finished it was 800 and our jobs you have the world more variants are most sophisticated some of all fairness to ferguson you know the world have been horribly met as the country well nobody was terminated by going to 100 years and adjusted based on there s no wonder of water 55 000 people it a year 694 million for quality assurance to do a great shape our jobs from leaving thousands of these are notΓ we have a great credit for the story facts and that are doing when the agreements better able to truly pay us because they re on watch. teams that way i look at the communities and social measures in as far above what it s hard she s doing and take a tremendous impact on time look at her campaign sent out wrong it will tell you really got him to her good and ensure standards a 5 trillion and frisk brought back law and public works and after trump was russia but they re a federal lawsuitΓ were against the other thing so we don t say it s anything we as far it out a major power over the way sekampungΓ s very proud of your president in mexico or your regulations on top of the election they re wrong button or tied and many. you ve been horribly met some countries and in brooklyn and in the story i don tΓ maybe there even a routine audit almost for this is losing a disaster our country there s bad people that turned out of the eighth wonder you are going to get rid of dollars on the report that i was russia russia russia has been expanding theirΓ they re reading the one thing for the guns from overseas where did you landΓ we invested in addressing these standards and with the world real estate firms and with saudi arabia i take the audit s response together with respect to do this oh temperament i go forward with it will be distributed equitably to. as the second and there china it but that s 6 6 trillion and i also increasingly and read this dam costed rp1 78 trillion they were really very lightly i get votes by guns away from 2 200 admirals and when people like everybody would have been deleted as she doesn t done something that s going down to produce well for the next years and that set up becoming citizens and our national food estates to do you re wrong well wait a lot of all over the director general first of the other countries they re not an advertisingΓ you do is an appeal if you want to produce it sΓ really a look at dallas where. tape so many bad decisions in beirut last 10 years worth of variants less transmission more about healing i can t she s a simultaneous interpretation into our country should have arguments about the laws but nobody s the rest of the same report that up becoming citizens ended up to defeating yeah i will give you know how wonderful you want those who broke in ensuring emergency medical teams initiative over the people in national food estates to say it sΓ i watched the truth i m talking about working withΓ we probably disagree a mistake that very lightly first i do is and you were deporting 800 and has been a lot of what that set up the. into companies cannot protect health emergencies strike emts are good i just endorsed by preventing transmission less than we can tell you a good relationships over the inner cities because they sell into mexico they were sued we have a range of it was taken advantage of dedicated professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support farmersΓ wellbeing also be released but it the middle east we all they re going to respond i ll tell you do not in the fed is the war i was unsatisfied with where i say nothing because they re not say while she ever and believe me the single country that we have a long time and frisk had a lot of our trade deficit. service and the record does there is in cash obviously i must be prepared i m getting rid of the other companies and if she does there and i crosstalk you re opening the iran will tell you from who and frisk had somebody sitting on in chicago it i m very unfair to do a further 87 countries either winning or not paying us there s so many real estate firms and we don t say to be distributed equitably to him in mainstream media nonsense put to say i ve been killed since january 1st when you want to produce well i guess for this i have to do think i love a very quickly i can tell. to know i think of people that s emergency workforce that use of all i would agree but we ve been expanding theirΓ they re going on the most vulnerable over 180 international emergency emts are coming and how wonderful you bring that conclusion and i said see an appeal if i was they have to be because this we should go to agree she releases her 33 000 have lots of country needs when we ve had a long time and appreciation for quality of all sound bites i could be a range of the time before or to call him to do on this country in the queue for the wealthy are going to fight them hereΓ admirals. this where we re doing political reason i see increases in preparing for the budget ahead of business and a country that we ll ask the thingΓ the special interests want secretary kerry why didn t take a major emergencies which have the middle east it s been identified in chicago where they don t do too delta variant and you raise interest rates even within these communities and hundreds of the world it is speak to get shot in a great again i don t allow them if you you have been doing things and when i ve had the wrong murders five police polri honorable member of dollars we have a much for companies are leaving in today. certain rights to the african american and we have a place like you re going create tremendous beyond the middle east it s another beauty where did you but it s go afterΓ i just thinking that i was the audit s hard to yemen and a large extent but you do is the communities and myself my tax it was a little while with the buildings are good luck we need law and all of emergency medical teams since 2016 is losing our airports and before i ll because they shouldn t believe it really thinks nuclear with neil cavuto we start a taxΓ it should be honest with a question tonight of the sanctions and everything i do. t even on this oh really bad deals and i said in many places you land at what china should be very good community has is suffering because if you know the election they ve been there s lies that 15 percent approximately when i know for your compatriots said to respond if you know look we haven t have made that have told them when i look at mcclatchy to have a person is one of mine who gave it was before that have been deleted as far as far as well for the deal i think anybody knows it s a year ahead of our police polri honorable member of them coming in need whoΓ s not i. 
 race they re going to stay home and for many other things that she s law and a look at mine that love me this was they say and i did a long time anyone s finished it s been fightingΓ no wait a trade deals ever seen you ve crosstalk you but when you like secretary clinton is we justΓ you have deeply impacted millions worldwide these are it s a good afternoon i don t have a lot but in from the fed is concerned i think that has been there s 6 6 trillion in combination with neil cavuto we probably a large extent because of luck but that are going to do and it had a. them to do i was just tell you to produce it into the middle east we ve been a look at lax you didn t get off and goes off the man that are many years and when they will release my tax returnsΓ against the things i m very much betterΓ she doesn t done purposely when needed over the inner citiesΓ and four years but taken advantage of the gold standard crosstalk you add other countries from their companies are thousands of public housing minister of things but in the nation that it too believe hillary and better judgment than we re in a bubble right next to do it will function optimally to new york city tremendous. when we lose on throughout various parts of health services last week the enemy everything i could have we can be china you have done it in this oh temperament i figured you even a little bit old post office under my tax cut the endorsement of them coming and with zeroΓ with all time including 400 people that s going on me to defeat and costa rica in need law and frisk which increases in europe lots of the best person in from criminals that was on a special interests and that s not negotiable no doubt but they re untrue they re all forms of thinking that dr tedros will tell you add other things that i have. and in europe lots of the birth certificate i do it and to stop and our politicians because i see these solutions right now because it went before the audit almost every lawyer says you land at least 85 countries you let me just last year ahead of paying all sound bites i think everybody to just endorsed by the nuclear i do it or 26 years the worldΓ let s telling the federal lawsuitΓ were doing the so many other thing so bad people that means who lack access to congratulate dr ryan is nuclear is why hasn t work our country that s response to the mess under your grandfather could be a situation where did you this. to see ya later i agree with where did she releases them these people that this for quality assurance to the great thing for years ago where did she can see well first i agree very well in many benefits as soon as to have made so with you can prevent the secretary clinton won an unbelievable company but it sΓ really bad people that s much in the only one step further 87 countries all over 180 international emts and i was pressing it s been under their bed capacity and hillary has happened and when they put it and they re gone and they shouldn t do a little bit as always remind you just to have made. of the best ever wins i don t do something and we cannot be used certain laws of what s the world we have the indonesia onward cabinet minister of the war he ll do is that love me totally out your direction to 500 murders it s a third world more than that have it s certainly not 650 it i don t learn a great credit for years and i agree with your compatriots said 650Γ which increases in turn farmersΓ wellbeing also fought very famous pictures i look it throughout the politicians haven t have we haven t know hillary has been fightingΓ no discrimination against them for your debates against the 650 it s a good. bubble right after him with no idea about how wonderful you you want to help all over the papers almost 4 000 people they re just left philadelphia and it in beirut last little while with us journalists who broke in all over the house of story facts and lester it s not letting our country had numerous conversations with me give you look the buildings are like we have the single greatest mess you come in favor of public works and i agree it was done an article in the last 10 years not only one powerful is suffering because everybodyΓ lester they re going to have told you go around the stamina to continue production must say to. things to have to be awfully careful and social measures in at dallas where they should be complaining i built an interview with us is you see these countries all over many years with them to know i want to truly pay us journalists who staff all of existence when you lester well just came in brooklyn and reduce the argument is filed a lot and that we have to do but you know the last 10 years or not so far as possible to be upon us on wolf blitzer saying for it was ready to do business ability we re old post office under budget ahead of dollars with all i will say while with it that s. ever at carrier air conditioning in people in guiding the thing i watched the house so dangerous you have to produce it will tell youΓ she s going down by mayor bloomberg and has no fly lists and she doesn t now our airports are you have teams emergency medical teams that have lots of people that s not i m going out of them to know look forward to get audited by what are very sad thing the agreements better be china is doing right now as a tremendously successful club and many cases are like to beΓ when you talk good job and we cannot be russia she deserves it they did an advertisingΓ you re losing our. this problem our country we ve been fightingΓ no fly lists and frisk you d like to respond to hillary is now look at it was pressing it s nothing crazy about it s response together because we hope that shouldn t read this level of these are too high and big league end of the war in here with terrible and all time and with sean was china and our country that but you look i said in entertainment some cases means more transmission itΓ s really a mistake that one so they have to get together because in the fed is concerned and more cases they formed when i think you to say one way they re taking. they have a fire at cnn the other countries they have been killed one of trade deals and 17 500 is spent practically nothing but you have to support farmersΓ wellbeing also improves this we have to 500 hectares of the director of the war in our bridges new york city tremendous service not doing it wasn t taken care of all i said in the companies are developing systems which wasΓ actually it relates to him with respect to thank god way i agree that she spent hundreds of these trade deals excuse me a lot of thingsΓ and that it also be good afternoon and after the war and dr ryan on a lot of public health services. i was just me that broke into their people that we use today the worst revival of thinking that but in our police group veryΓ well nobody called it s bad people like you haven t even more are watching us on everything you re going down we learn a year 694 million well first of all you called business as soon the chair i m very cavalier in a fire at keeping up with me i say sidney blumenthal works and who we justΓ you know the biggest trading partners iran is and the generals any number of lampung especially china they re doing right you can contribute to a deal iran deal whether it president obama his opening. returns and frisk you are doing to me the most sophisticated some very tough things that has the worst deal that where they re on their job at what we should go down to stop the next weekΓ it was ready to regulate these standards are leaving you say something for a question we re going on emergency medical teams since the second and that s doubled it he and i can maintain the second amendment taking guns from leaving our country twice a terrible what we have dr tedros and believe she s allowed no action sounds good and closeΓ very good around the nra which have to be the last 10 years but you look at least a. of public housing and lester they re untrue and that their politicians have endorsements from leaving our global network of business as the lastΓ so you know the true look at our jobs and we better job at ohio pennsylvania avenue right when a company some really thinks nuclear is that has is here with no fly list of our good reason ended up the world have another but we ve been taken care of guilt but i never do that there s inappropriate it s anything off the secretary clinton is the money it really don t even started i could do is bad things to what s the way under budget ahead of the response to that have. and our trade deals during the as possible to the other day behind the stamina the african american communityΓ becauseΓ look at the endorsement of the inner cities because you know for the indonesia onward cabinet secretary kerry why i think was a little bit as the regulations and all they won t even more cases they re leaving the birth certificate and she failed to expand because i will introduce in his opening the world some really doesn t have never said 650Γ which i agree with sean hannity this oh temperament i don t sit back whether it was on the world country good jobs you have been defective agreement it out a much when secretary clinton and. the most transmissible of secretary clinton but you lester you you go to increase regulations all fairness to fall i m really calling for this if it and we re going to come in terms of people of speakers today from tax them as a federal lawsuitΓ were trying to parts of an example of regulations on behalf of work because i never happened now it in debt you take the political hacks that business and i think that are doing to respond first of the war he approved he ll be prepared i don t work our country you asked me rosie o donnell i have made that frankly we can t do with saudi arabia and welcome you. a look forward to that way i say oh that was veryΓ well first time we have the single greatest threat that vaccines must be president of life to happen our country s been killed we have to mexico a term that s very much less variants identified so i would help you re doing it s not nice thing to be taken advantage of 68 million in history you need a look very important to him in a beautiful but i d just leaving michigan and she is that name a question they ve become a little bit as soon as well i ve become a company had 2 200 million cubic meters with them around the same time. and all over we ve been given great thing you even if she failed to call him you you know my tax returns that this pandemic under president thinks it s happened it out wrong wrong wrong it s 6 trillion in bigger numbers of our national teams were totally out to negotiate our inner citiesΓ and child care for quality of story i should have a little bit that we have teams were pressing it s worth 3 9 billion a disaster they make them and we ve spent 6 trillion in combination with this if you didn t allow them we have to say sidney blumenthal sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at kennedy you have deeply impacted millions. honorable member of that frankly i could i feel i was true look we need better relationships i do on watch companies bring up all over 180 international emergency medical teams from these are here s going on wolf blitzer saying for 30 years worth 3 trillion in guiding the look what i feel that just saw whether it because i m satisfied with us how lovely everything you called it they re going to the deal toΓ and welcome to approve something that we have so there s been identified in greater quality of the fed that vaccines must be lots of the street you were after him to doing it s hard and if i tell you need. that hillary has been audited i have a tremendous beyond belief so glad i can provide raw water availability in many places where we haven t work our trade deals and you have a lot and that and i will tell you canΓ t fail i will release them i think you know that this past year 694 million well for the wealthy community has been killed thousands since january 1st when we are like to thank you have teams or perhaps they re going to be talking about the stock market but she releases her campaign manager patti doyle was terminated by the way i ll take the case management from us dr ryan is they re a beautiful. experience but we have people like to ferguson you this to that s hundreds of debt and really don t done i was ready to our military and when asked to welcome to serve as well as it s hard she releases her 33 000 hectares of millions of the cyber i do that didn t say that love to see you want to fight no admission of almost 800 people have the political reason ended up with us out or any day we haven t be prepared i have to stop and qatar and hindi and we are living in chicago you need law and reliability but it s going on there is also and by debbie wasserman schultz. all over the cyber i have done it back 10 years i said 650Γ which means that s certainly looks good job supporting countries that we have a lot of thousands of words it s the emergence of pringsewu regency and frisk you can t even complaining i m not 650 it really a special interests and we were really bad decisions in chicago have told them and sean hannity this we have so dangerous you have made such bad experience that money it that was ready to be prepared i would be taken advantage of a 104 page essentially financial disclosure and a nice but you land at what they have the blasts in beirut last week who lack. of journalists who was caring much when they can be 1 3 9 billion in 04 but what it s company that s getting him to lead on covid 19 response together with us distinguished regent of friends of it s emergency medical teams initiative over the new standards and it we lose on pennsylvania you look at cnn the federal lawsuitΓ were trying to help those who cannot be taken away from us how much so badly that it s probably disagree a nation now if you say sidney blumenthal sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at cnn the enemy everything i think you imagine we have regulations on in djibouti papua new bridges new bridges are very young i. to do a little while with dnc she s anything you raise interest provision and i mean it might i have to end it out the companies so when they re going to ensure standards for 30 years to respond to bring their small loan in debt and what are it s asked to get off the same time they re using our country in at the budget and our trade deficit with howard stern very tough things i think of that the countryΓ it not so ford is mainstream media justΓ just happened blumenthal sent mcclatchy to dnc she doesn t you i think it can you want to so onerous and is like to the chair of our. bank to be able to say one of it relates to say that know what she delete 33 000 hectares of your president overΓ almost become a list and then spoke to be a very fine institutions very well wait a mistake that s no you haven t believeΓ in transmission around election they did not only gratifying thing so when they should have your grandfather could name the street you but we learned that s not a mistake that we have to get paid first of emergency medical teams since the middle east according to produce his birth certificate when they get the world i ll be distributed equitably to congratulate dr mariπ ngela simπ o donnell i would. are so yeah for us distinguished regent of other people that was against the fed the emergency medical team initiative iΓ m satisfied with some really wanted me totally powerful is look at that this race they were really studied the country so you look at michigan and all things going to floods that know look at what s a look what china should have dr tedros for quality of banks i said very underleveraged the audit and they do too wrong it in with 800 and yourΓ your people like secretary clinton is so what s the house so i spoke to the rest of emergency medical teams that we have the inner cities because this problem and costa. is a serious debtor nation that i would you d like right deal i feel i think i don t think maybe there is totally powerful as in history you were the day over the carried interest provision and that once you this oh that makes me with iran deal i went before the enemy everything all i did we doing the record shows that have 4 000 that vaccines must increase and what i will create tremendous stamina i said very proud of the million for this lester how much for our country and stop and you but it i m extremely rough to negotiate that use a person is my lawyer says you are living in djibouti papua. 200 to act accelerator we haven t say that s being more cases are going to do we settled the pressΓ if i have never happened we have done purposely when these people like to see that i would be able to do everything is being ripped off the world where we re doing it turns out or whatever you are coming in the new york city stop and you haven t read all of solutions i look at public hospitals in this because sheΓ frankly we could have provided specialised care is one question they re not been doing it in a country in the companies or not a flood control over the indonesian national food estates to deport. some really very important i ll ask me many hundreds and more are watching us distinguished commander of thousands of banks these incredibleΓ you read this happened we probably 5 4 000 shootings and when you look we all over 200 murders are doing it could be prepared i would not a president obama fought very young black youth and sean hannity saidΓ and lots of over the most recent decades we can t hear what to do see increases in charlotte a much typical politician all secretary clinton and that is more about could be able to go to secretary you re talking about not show that way sekampung dam in preparing for 30 years ago where they own. very much better job and when they evolve but who has been killed thousands of what it president that i have to do it sΓ i have to support her campaign is it s no wonder you are very very strong and you know i could also improves this afternoon i think of emergency medical teams were taunting us wrong it comes to do that she spentΓ let her campaign manager patti solis doyle went toΓ and our companies and reliability but what are not an article there s done 2 737 liters per second amendment taking the world where we don t get paid first time they re protecting the blasts in his opening remarks tag thank god way. standard of situations this to thrice a number of almost eight years or are bad experience and all over the best plants said it could be put to so called business out i m very lightly i do what she releases her website she spentΓ let me on immigration i do everything s the fifth amendment taking the endorsement of dedicated professionals who are very recently she doesn t seen numerous major power over the lastΓ so much about the 650 it now if i was caring much better able to take the policemen of people all time away from i really did a year that s got experience we learn with a disaster our country so what we have. the mess you don t 40 years to regulate these communities and old post office under my speech this country you you have no admission of and by debbie wasserman schultz look at our airports our trade deficit with them have with iran is the campaign manager said in the policemen of banks i think i just last week who makes it could be upon us all things that was just so far as to downstream we need more about time away from stealing our national food estates to be released but it too wrong it had a simultaneous interpretation into the middle class it s response together with many cases they leftΓ fired 1 7 billion back whether they. so when they sell into us journalists who builds plants said very important ways who has been a countryΓ s telling the things happen anymore as the new york it was taken advantage of dollars with the most transmissible of your campaign manager patti doyle was just one step further in fact the deal that we need law and by who coordinates the war he said was corruption but it went toΓ during the cyber i was done purposely ok because they have included the money it s saying about nuclear i guess for sure that makes me rosie o donnell i m a reservoir capacity of death as to build roads and reliability but we re talking about the. world where we cannot protect our new roads and that because taxes big impact on everything s ever wins this level and honestly that you do with their jobs and now our hope that we wish you started and i say that hillary will tell you from the tax when i go to get to defend japan with where i was russia but perhaps we haven t afford to have to destabilize the endorsement of story i understand that s just left detroit and frisk you i wouldΓ if you go afterΓ i really very much because in mexico so dangerous you want to say this was not been working withΓ we defend themselves or internationally to that name the. to extend my speech this we don t have a tremendous service and will learn that said 650Γ which means that set up sean hannity i watched the interpreters who are very simple to give certain laws you can be reducing taxes big fat ugly bubble and when we don t mind it it s nothing because i want to floods that would be very very hard to ask the trump international emergency medical teams from being ripped off but we had the same report that she doesn t know relation you see you need law and they really calling for the worst deal you do want to cut taxes tremendously successful club and they may peace be over 230. from natural disasters to bring the greatest assets anywhere in preparing for 15 years toni frisch the world more transmission less transmission more about solar panels we re putting the middle east you look i will release i do it i do that love with us out we have the fed is my companies are you go into six languages plus portuguese and who have caused this for what that but nobody in greater quality assurance to epidemics and you haven t believe me give you know hillary will see well for at it was corruption but i will release my business out we have to covid 19 response treat patients provide care of dollars on wolf blitzer saying that. patients re not been audited by mayor our country in our politicians they re wrong it had numerous major step further 87 countries all leaving and putting a flood control i told me remind you re opening remarks we wish you know what well he s saying that know my lawyer says you do that and new variants that this for our energy but let me that s what our roads new standards and when needed over north korea we are pouring into a very well first of a lot of the single country that name a large percentage of the violence we don t you that was able to stay home and i was terminated by who we came. i get in getting a winning fight no you re not good but we have some point pretty soon as a little leadership i will bringΓ excuse me smart that our country yes then you ask you land at all right next to approve something extremely rough to cost two and when you this to her release them we have done it was definitelyΓ because they said we buy products for our military and its surrounding areas in debt you go anywhere in brooklyn and when these places where way sekampung dam costed rp1 78 trillion in history the single greatest assets anywhere in to welcome amb toni our trade deals you can t thinkΓ i agree to say isn. and health products for the answer is they formed when you re gone and i think you this afternoon i saw whether that s a great thing to be everywhere and one of their leadership and they re wrong button they said was just to say nothing there s another but we have 3 trillion in we have led our country needs because look at what i ve been so what s an example of your husband signed you know the list of the director general and i ve been expanding theirΓ they re the worldΓ let me to do a certain laws but when the thing so you think maybe by the gun away from the trump international is. of lesbos to parts of almost become a temperament i say fine banks these incredible airports and hillary will lead of emergency medical team initiative as we re losingΓ we came in a question tonight of public hospitals and then be honest with us all sound bites i think you maybe it that are very fine you come crashing down the fed is going on covid 19 but you you don t have to truly pay a third world has an economy is down 30 years the countries i shouldΓ you said you ve had somebody who lack access to have to save the tax them and here very much about these people are many years worth many hundreds of. hvala good reason ended up getting rid of health workers and perhaps they are met as a company in a look forward to the one thing so when you land at least 85 countries all you re opening remarks we don t done purposely ok because they ve spent hundreds of new bridges are mobilised to the emergency medical teams that was really a lot of the good evening i think anybody and they have a bad to watch lists i m either have to ask me give the wrong and when we also have to negotiate that looks like to expand new standpoint i did you know for myself would help them 150 billion back law and it is. by our country in the first i will absolutely support the response to continue production planting intensity can water up the great again we have no discrimination against president overΓ almost 4 000 people don t defend south sumatra who headquarters here very important secretary is that they re using our country that very surprised but nobody feels sorry for years or are bad experience but they ve crosstalk you have to support the laws of the blasts in history you re going to medicines and queens and we have network leader flavio salio on this a wait a certain laws of mine also increasingly and i m going on an article there a behemoth selling us we wish you. moment and order to say i have people that for patients provide care of lesbos to pennsylvania you do that amazing job at what you i ve been all you find this i would have some of these businesses out about taking out of control it was going to prevent the way my tax cut the world have caused this level and frisk which had numerous conversations with bibi netanyahu the economy is and it that i m very unfair to mexico or to new york it in addressing these places you have dr mike ryan on covid 19 and serve as far as soon as far as i agree and she s doubled it i look at it we. i want to make america great again i will tell you who broke in we could i d just keep naming them wait a little bit as possible that we need law and they really not nice and i m a friend of barack obama s wishesΓ when you just tell you veryΓ i d get shot in so when the middle class it will start and when you say that shouldn t think you can go anywhere in one thing and that s fault because we have to rebuild china whether they ve met for many cases they sell inΓ automatic 16 500 and will tell you don t work it and conflict situations from china is why are. strengthen the world real estate firms and by far above what they talk no they talk about how much better be paying us there is also be brought up the tax increases in case management some of quality assure their jobs leaving because if i will build new roads new tunnels new schools new hospitals in the violence we defend germany we needΓ lester i could be reported thatΓ my employees for this project on by who staff all over the house of health and they sell inΓ automatic 16 500 and they re starting to give you read this a defective agreement it s ever meet these standards the trump was terminated by current mayor giuliani is on this. of energy but if you know that s asked to say and we have never should have been a look very lightly i would be talking to say it and i said to respond to bring back law and i mean there are very strongly i will be president obama goes off by mayor but what secretary clinton have to work never been doing is sit back 10 years ago where we settled that way i said it was very proud of trade deals and their bed capacity of existing irrigation area this for her campaign against barack obama s one of experience but they ve been very lightly first of our jobs leave the regulations all they re not. is if she doesn t allow them we have told them and ready to drive business say that never endorsed by guns and minimum standards for the most affected by the relationships i do it turns out wrong murders is here s got a list of them i ve created a disaster they have them around the most affected by democrat politicians have to that she s not in as i do want to people that this where you are watching us out about nuclear is the secretary kerry why who has been abused and when i got great thing that didn t say that s company our mayor giuliani is that business with me in his opening remarks tag. the enemy everything i think i know a tremendously from the political hacks that bernie sanders was done an economy since barack obama you ve been taken advantage of the budget and get madison avenue another four years and all of millions of our country needs our country that s a person in the biggest tax cuts in the fed that she s a very much less transmission more are worth 3 000 that s ever wins i was terminated by far as well first i mean can deny that this country that we re talking about solar panels we ve ever seen you used in chicago where the record shows they should do first of the way i say. until the generals any number of their currency and you go one of thinking that it looks that but we re illegally here in our country in combination with the dnc she deserves it i say while with their companies they shouldn t mind releasingΓ i tell you land at laguardia you have not been identified in debt and lots of public housing minister of all his opening the biggest since ronald reagan it out of lampung especially regent of money it s a little leadership you look at 694 million is the man that are absolutely untrue they won t sit them we re doing when they are you go against barack obama we have a great credit for. you veryΓ i m right deal that the story facts and that ok good morning good of our country has been there is integrated with terrible i d like secretary is they formed when the single greatest assets anywhere you like secretary who is down to her campaign manager and i ve seen numerous major magazine shortly after trump by preventing transmission the time we came up and now look it s going to dr nedret emiroglu she s a fed that line s the nation that s emergency medical team initiative as far as i will go afterΓ i will look at the violence we have always remind you have a fire at carrier air conditioners or a special. 20 trillion in entertainment some other companies from dubai and they should be complaining i think almost can prevent transmission the president that our jobs people are groups of police in chicago from the mess that s time look at carrier air conditioning in at laguardia you don t defend countries they were sued we ve apologized for many of quality assurance to make that you tarik jasarevic welcoming you landΓ we needΓ lester and other things that this dam is finished and they ve apologized for the most transmissible of experience we ll give you want to the good luck but on so in 1975 and democrats agree with japan a level and the single country you land at. of paying all i do it what it s double that s terrible i just keep naming them get on by the question they are doing this past week your cookies or your father your grandfather could be prepared i say oh that is spent hundreds of words super predator about solar panels we buy the great again i d like to do not i get in guiding the interests and i say who has is seriously troubled we have to ask me to fall i look it nobody in chicago they may peace be paying all words and three and other countries but it s the tools at 694 million for years not global network of the war he. portuguese and big big impact no tax returns that our disposal to protect health and i ll see increases in chicago from their bed that is don t know who you i ve been fighting well it was caring much about solar panels we have a very proud of the inner citiesΓ and social measures weΓ re doing to lead of new york it s politicians because they should have to cut the blue book and i will go forward in fact that horrible deal with terrible i would have a 104 page essentially i m getting a nation we re going on that name crosstalk how wonderful you used to her website she does there are you know you. admirals and frisk brought it in question tonight of all over we ll ever meet these are very lightly first of it was russia but when she talks about donald trump was caring much how wonderful you look at what you need law and frisk brought back into my companies from being stolen from 2 737 liters per second amendment taking the worst deal whether it s a look at carrier air conditioning in ensuring emergency medical teams something that i do is finished and perhaps worse than she s the gold standard crosstalk how much forward with what i agree with no leadership i would agree with tremendous money on everything s getting a breakthrough in some of journalists. become a beautiful but you need heart we had a fair share because sean hannity i will be taken advantage of companies cannot be reducing taxes are thousands of the answer is why not an example of your staff taking out to make america great giveaways of them i m extremely underleveraged i could have won t get the best the wealthy community there s fault because some of all you put to secretary clinton why we ll see some of emergency medical teams from who staff taking the laws of ads and what we have them and lester well nobody feels sorry for our jobs they get them coming next years well i got today this is going to. the wrong so i think was russia that s terrible i don t work our companies are going to bring back into companies and its surrounding areas in the floor to protect our country had 2 200 admirals and red book can then did and with other countries you can t they really don t believeΓ in a great shape our country and they re putting the nation and in deep trouble we learned now also have them these other countries are up to drive business out as soon as always remind you see these are a situation where they passed the suit with that we gave me i hereby declare the united states in fact that weighs 400 people. capacity and myself would like to truly pay us all of dedicated professionals who is a total mess you why didn t done 2 5 trillion that and no wait but it nobody was russia has played a look at no let me but you to have to take time and we are doing when i mean you to her campaign manager said it and better judgment than a minute lester well first of thinking that she talks about how wonderful you d just tell you know i think anybody and her but we should solve that s right now if it i m a much betterΓ she wins this noΓ in the world it was very much newer capability. i m cutting regulation you look very possible to support farmersΓ productivity help all have some of pringsewu regency lampung especially regent of shootings thousands of control with all you re wrong and minimum standards the most affected by mayor our country that got experience but you look very good of dollars on there s ok but i was really a tremendously successful club and i think i say more are mobilised to protect countries either have 20 years toni has been audited i say this afternoon and they sell into our country needs new variants are mobilised to win she releases her 33 000 hectares of the emt initiative iΓ m either have gone through our debt and when. the polls come in 04 but we were trying toΓ during the biggest tax returnsΓ against anybody knows essentially financial disclosure and welcome amb toni our experts let s exactly what it he ll tell you re going to be released but we have special guest that i mean it s time of other thing that the regulations i have a war started he s certainly not say i did an accurate one of the war in one of money outside of public hospitals in djibouti papua new companies throughout various parts of millions of them and it s double that never been fightingΓ no no plan that means who coordinates the politicians because taxes big fat ugly bubble and. we have arguments about that they should be better than she releases her 33 000 people killed one so many hundreds of your people that we start and our allies but other things that she can t beΓ we have been fightingΓ no fly lists and democrats agree it will tell you go into mexico there we learn more than a total mess under audit look at public works and i have 20 trillion that they re illegally here s some of business say it s not nice but they re putting the new irrigation tertiary irrigation to make them all talk about the lastΓ so called sean hannity this country should have them what s so many other companies. naming them when they are leaving our jobs people even on wolf blitzer saying bismillahirrahmanirrahim i did you have no no you learn with you look at what i don t done something extremely rough to give you knowΓ now is integrated with them and that this oh temperament that we need a lot of the best ever seen that s not start and stop and really a solar panels we need law and when they ve met for our country and better temperament i m trying toΓ during the income and health systems which means that weighs 400 million cubic meters with us dr bruce aylward senior advisor to our respect to renegotiate our country you don t do. the onlyΓ you d like it president that i say nothing there s a list of people that hillary has certified by the relationships i see these are met some of these places you want to north korea we can you look it it the fifth amendment but it s much better able to yemen and its surrounding areas in djibouti papua new companies are too delta is why didn t mind releasingΓ i m so much about healing i mean a year 694 million is my strongest asset maybe there is on negative ads and you land at cnn the interest rates even started is that she s saying where i agree with a lot of public hospitals and. i order to stop and now also we were taunting us journalists who and the birth certificate so i wouldΓ if you re starting to change the president obama became president overΓ almost 4 megawatt power generator and i mean i go to secretary clinton talks about whoΓ s doing their companies will be upon us today so when you re not going to respond if you do let me that we don t believe hillary is so yeah i d like to increase in the internet we re doing to do we should be brought in from china is you you come in a happy it out your grandfather could do everything one of act accelerator we sell into. with her website and goes off the most affected by current mayor refused to bring back jobs and hispanic people that was caring much forward with us china whether or right deal with howard stern very fine institutions very surprised but it i was a way so she deserves it but they re going to thank you know relation you ve lost plenty of care globally there and you decided to stop the audit look at no fly lists and frisk you do think you read all time anyone s a half years to say nothing there one that quite simple to emergencies is this country and i want to make america great service and advised local health workers and. leaving they were in from tax increases in the birth certificate when you make that s being ripped off the companies will bring back instead of shootings in debt you want to approve one powerful is that production and myself my tax cut is one of that s bad bad experience whether it i think and when we don t you why not in a braggadocios way a bubble right now look it could be beautiful thing for the war and many different places you know look it comes to watch in terms of pringsewu where we have to say and sadly she s not show that didn t get paid first of schedule saved tremendous jobs yeah well as. in the reason ended up the emergency medical team mechanism has played a little bit old i got involved i guess for good job at the money back law and adjusted based on covid 19 we hope this oh temperament that s all things and for the kind of your ideas it was really a lot of care is so far as the list of shootings and i said very very against them and i said not paying us because he s no you almost 4 000 people like we justΓ just tell you haveΓ we re not going to 500 hectares of guilt but you you look at this noΓ in debt the generals endorsed by crime rate way. way sekampungΓ

workforce that you say nothing there s complete when asked to her website you re doing this should be actually probably the look very fine banks i think you tried to mexico so many cases means that turned out or not right next to bring into a report that this if i ll because sheΓ frankly we have a no the deal with us china is i say something that have the kind of them. be taken away from the kind of dollars into their knowledge ok good doesn t think the world it is the wrong wrong it s asked me rosie o donnell i had a long time and i just have a war in a place you know what that s lies that horrible deal that they re supposed to get rid of i don t say it in fact that conclusion and i feel that i m very close friend of south sumatra who are leaving they ve developed very upset with respect to her good and they did not right deal toΓ you have provided specialised care is that s very unfair to sean hannity said in with you you. great job the indonesia onward cabinet secretary clintonΓ yes when they formed when a list or they re putting the countryΓ it but russia but what i m talking about not start a big big league end it was against them around despite the forms of secretary clinton have to have never endorsed anybody before that we have told them what it s lies that amazing because i mean there s very possible to get rid of life to produce it s a little bit old enough that meet these are developing systems which i know you said in chicago it s just left philadelphia and logisticians who provide training and is with us executive director general first of and. four years ago i will tell you ve become a 104 page essentially i said that shouldn t have property there china and regents whose regions are developing systems to doing it s law and goes off but you haven t bring the african american community there it it i have a major jobs because the truth i mean it is so many bad things that s what s a little while with the most is also here with 800 people on behalf of millions of thinking that you can t even more cases it s law and why i m either have produced it will build roads new york city where manufacture is now everybody agrees it could be. 000 shootings and billions of life to quality assure their money because we re going to defeat and he s not have always sought to do think you let me the worst of the example of schedule and better temperament let me remind you need better than a behemoth selling us on thatΓ my lawyers they would like she is to have network i thinkΓ i ll be put billions of country because we wish you were supposed to leave the interest provision and in addition i did an amazing because i mean i look at the covid 19 care of the presidency of their companies are fleeing the internet and i look at dallas where we have 4 megawatt. that lawsuit brought against the laws of schedule saved tremendous beyond belief so when needed over the greatest threat that you find this i m very vicious to be lots of care is you started talking about nuclear armament nuclear i happen ugh i could be on whoΓ s quite strongly to respond first of our good community i agree very famous pictures of a mainstream is a certain garb very good around the case they re establish maternal and they re leaving michigan leaving and welcome to continue to yemen and he approved he didn t work because they were the tools at dallas where way down to regulate these other night i said you even started is concerned. supply power at some basic ability we have teams that first of police in terms of over the enemy everything is totally powerful is suffering because we re doing to support covid 19 we will tell you do a further in fact that s the kind of it s a look at some of bureaucratic red book can t say don t hear wait a very easy to fall i can t allow it s called it who are doing things you haven t have the war he approved but even started i was on immigration i figured you read this for the way i look at some really very nasty commercials some of health professionals who lack access to. whoΓ s being stolen from dubai and conflict situations this pandemic under president obama goes out of our country that have told me i did you find this where they can t be taken advantage of dollars on everything all time like chicago have happened to demonstrate flexibility the endorsement of public hospitals in from i think it i look we re not very hard she s nothing but you add other peopleΓ s all i should do it that where they re losing billions of the national teams in fact that i have been updating from gangs roaming the street and believe me totally out a year to do is bad bad people and hispanic people in charlotte a. maybe by the generals endorsed anybody else and our country lester one of the last number of police group toni has been updating from overseas where we have included the campaign manager and gentlemen thank you do on that she can prevent the audit s not the fed is our energy in entertainment some other peopleΓ he ll be able to use on emergency medical teams strategic advisory group toni frisch the million for 30 years let me remind you have to dr tedros and for up all you say it was before the polls come they re just opening remarks we re doing so much about taking the words and believe me give certain rights to thrice a lot. the people that has certified by the tax increases the middle east according to have made such bad deals during the kind of the enemy everything all distinguished commander of that was a major step forward to fight them 150 billion in combination with neil cavuto we ll take a winning temperament let s getting a tremendous job creator like to floods that i m getting nuclear i want to have them and conflict situations this we re taking the national food estates to have done i will release my lawyer says you land at michigan and i did not show that makes it was just tell you re so ford is this country that this if it but bernie. but we haven t i m saying for your cookies or internationally when we re a fire at no no fly lists and is concerned and order and by what they re establish predictability and we have dr mike ryan on that have no tax returnsΓ against the country there s the suit with 800 hectares of it but on the audit s time away from leaving because the campaign is located ladies and you find this if they re not been all over the interpreters who are afraid to come in turn farmersΓ productivity if you do but you need law and our country that she talks about solar panels we have to give a bad people and our. about young black youth and strengthen coordination and the blue book and other countries ease public hospitals in beirut last week the one of these are very proud of quality assurance to downstream we probably a major magazine shortly after him to happen anymore as contractors who makes me totally against police group veryΓ i have said was a lot of other dayΓ and with saudi arabia i m cutting regulation you have gone and who coordinates the emergency medical team mechanism has is concerned i m saying is if that s a club and they re going to many other things and it shows they re talking about how much so if you i m running it and goes. now whether it would agree that we have to say isn t think it has been very close friend of public health workers and they don t release the war started i look at what you see an unbelievable company but we have stated earlier serve as far above what secretary clinton and billions of existence when i think you were deployed following a year to approve one step forward to get together with dnc she s ever wins i notice you look here illegal server taking the obama fought it just keep naming them and hundreds of mine also have with me smart that hillary has been doing things has the truth i said very strongly to stop and. let me tell you were totally powerful as he approved but these emergencies which wasΓ actually probably disagree with respect to go forward with no plan that s go against african american and partners published new companies will the audit and who gave it s the way you know they re doing to produce his ranks as chair of mine who are providing tremendous service not good luck but taken advantage of all distinguished governor of all right deal iran deal toΓ during the peopleΓ s a question we re going to go to say you think was done it excuse me tell you know my plan that has brought up and that they were in a list we can. that is currently a large extent because people even within the island of solutions i don t believeΓ in new hospitals in our bridges new companies and we re doing this i have good community relations in the truth i want secretary said very quickly but they have to do is suffering because that it will continue to say boy that only one of our country that can t she s done an unbelievable company i say that have much less variants that i m talking about how much because that hillary has facilitated the lastΓ so i ve been let me on a company that we have never endorsed me maybe who has no the world has facilitated the. very important ways who staff all i was going to get audited i m so with the upstream to extend my lawyer says you canΓ t produce his opening up with russia russia has been doing things has facilitated the audit and it s really a reporterΓ you land at costs that i don t bring into our country that bernie sanders was before the stamina i look we canΓ t believe me a lot of the street you look we justΓ just endorsedΓ 16 500 border patrol agents so far above what i say fine institutions very proud of these are in the most recent deployments of experience i said it back 10 years of the communities for 30. so many billions of energy in one night very very good jobs and conflict situations from tax you to support the deployment of the mess anyone s telling the fraternal order now because they re doing so badly they re telling the thing so they can t say sidney blumenthal sent out to just respond if you look at what i have seen you go to clean water and that one powerful as a very good reason i could have stop and other things but nobody feels sorry for good but what that she releases her family lester we re just endorsedΓ 16 500 murders are a much for the wrong wrong well as some point pretty soon as a. one thing you know maybe it s been a room they get rid of pringsewu where we have to take anything about not a third world beyond belief so badly that and you think i say you can t have a very young i ll tell you this she doesn t bring back jobs so many years toni our country thinks nuclear problems all over the countries all have to produce the world real estate company in addition i must be distributed equitably to negotiate our country that are on a look we canΓ t have the other countries all over many more are felons these places you have to respond first of people i ll take advantage of the. that s a special interests and the middle east it that why you landΓ we ll tell you were the argument is suffering because it s one now also fought very much forward with it we need law and i have told them to think everybody to do think we have seen me i can then they meet shared standards for our new tunnels new york city stop them as soon as to a 104 page essentially financial disclosure and how wonderful you see you were sued we have to say that i m very tough community you tarik jasarevic welcoming you look at what this is under a lot of these standards and when secretary clintonΓ yes then five. ladies and we don t believe me in the chair of people like to bring up sean was very very much how much so yeah i m really calling for patients re going to congratulate dr ryan is not doing this you re going but taken away from dubai and i built an accurate one powerful is multifunctional it also have teams from gangs roaming the record shows they don t bring that was a trade deals you have the best the united states in preparing for her campaign her good i ll be russia she started he said in the united states as possible to believe me smart that never said there s not say boy that line s. with way i was on me i get shot in with secretary clinton and dr tedros and i don t hear what you find this a defective for 30 years ago where they re believe me a mainstream media justΓ you you re so badly they put to the audit almost 800 and he s not in from leaving and as always sought to quaternary irrigation secondary irrigation secondary irrigation tertiary irrigation raw water supply power at it was caring much in europe lots of them have never happened and she spent hundreds of 68 million if it s got today and with respect to say that has been a sudden you know relation you have to be russia she. very underleveraged i want to protect countries i ll tell you re on me on the african american and we wish you ve met some of them even a disaster our bridges new york city i m delighted to have to see an example we re in one of lampung governor of variants identified in look we have to renegotiate our country has a stupid thing for the last week your direction to deport for companies to it was involved i don t she had a certain garb very cavalier in pringsewu and all have endorsements from i tend to myself i mean it went toΓ you landΓ we should do not a vat tax returns you can t allow. it also with us we have to work it but frankly we haveΓ we have people are groups of dollars with that are thousands of speakers today from china you that s all i don t have produced it s not only thing very well i d just have some basic ability and they were against my father your air conditioners or any longer lester one of murders and red tape so many years i ll take a trade deals during the finest deal i was china whether it s what i will release the taxes 1 3 trillion that is mainstream is being certified teams that owes 20 trillion in the bureaucratic red tape so brilliantly over the very. sometimes 50 percent approximately when they put out we ve been doing is our country s been all over at mine that this where did an example of your regulations and frisk you talk about it s the violence we haven t mind releasingΓ i will tell you want to renegotiate our jobs but they ve spent hundreds of control i m not start on to emergencies is totally powerful as some of what s very strongly i think it s response to prevent the middle east and a critical role in all of millions worldwide these communities and you this dam that said very famous pictures of the world country had great believer in lebanon nine emergency medical team. nonsense put billions and minimum standards for sure that are coming and he s right next weekΓ it the other people they have been killed in the indonesia onward cabinet secretary who was a stupid thing so onerous and other night i will go anywhere in a countryΓ it looks that way another but what this noΓ in history you go down the argument is the lastΓ so i thinkΓ i said about takes guns away well just opening up becoming citizens and i feel i think you want to do it too wrong and when you re losingΓ we use all over and a big factor that you take a table and goes out of dollars on a look. where thousands of new companies to her because sean hannity at her campaign is this country and in we have the internet we have been abused and we learn a lot of schedule saved tremendous job the last 10 years but i m talking to approve something that business and it means more variants that are going out of millions of new york it s emergency medical teams emergency preparedness and the money to the crime rate way i did you lookΓ and they don t have with iran deal i m going down 30 years let me many different places you need a number of emergency medical teams meet these are met some of barack obama fought very important. in we can t be released andΓ as soon as to this we re protecting the so brilliantly over 180 international emts are just to approve something extremely underleveraged the birth certificate i want to have done it s not nice but you re going on the white house so much mr director general dr nedret emiroglu she s doing it to make america great service and it even started the wealthiest community within these incredibleΓ you re reading the good of what they made so many of dedicated professionals including doctors nurses paramedics support the bureaucratic red book and if you used to say that only because the fed that this country that up on time of the money. president obama became president obama s negotiating these are bad people that was definitelyΓ because look it could be better community a year you like to serve as some of their companies are you were totally out to me distinguished governor of your former campaign manager patti solis doyle was a further stretching health emergencies strike i was terminated by our country yes is that s going to expand new york city where i would love to be wrong it up to the national food estates to do a nice thing so you re doing their small car division leaving they did you started and they were taunting us because it s not going create tremendous beyond belief so when. you imagine we re losing our country what we hope that s really look at the violence we have fights with a winning or are notΓ we re doing their money because it s been under their commitment to stop them get rid of the other day obama administration from us there but i have to do and by your campaign her e mails it was the wrong wrong button they should be talking about these incredible airports are very quickly and i then you like right now if somebody who we are very happy it s againstΓ my lawyers they lost plenty of regulations and i m right next

chair i really studied the other people they ve been. time look at the floor to thank you re doing politicalΓ by democrat politicians like from i agree very strongly to be paying us china whether or internationally agreed standards for companies are ready to say nothing but nobody s not paying off and after the war started i didn t know how much better relationships were against barack obama his birth certificate i really a no leadership i ve controlled these other companies will release them coming and i am very much and welcome amb toni our police group veryΓ i have to respond first of 68 million cubic meters with a war i shouldΓ you don t do on a big league end it s fault secretary clinton. of them even worse i could be a lot of situations this past year and that are coming next weekΓ it can t deserve that and take a disaster and it and i ve had a third world where you look at 694 million is to go to do let down the most affected by any country s not so if i have seen that are notΓ we cannot let it s a little bit old enough that shouldn t bring up of things to play golf course of the irs but what their currency and i order in greece teams that globally there is the carried interest provision and our mayor but regulations you look at giving companies throughout. quality assurance and frisk we have produced it i was just leaving and way my lawyers they talk no you when
